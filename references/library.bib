  abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) provide a unified framework for simultaneously analyzing data sets of different types to estimate vital rates, population size, and dynamics; assess contributions of demographic parameters to population changes; and assess population viability. Strengths of an IPM include the ability to estimate latent parameters and improve the precision of parameter estimates. We present a hierarchical IPM that combines two broad-scale avian monitoring data sets; count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and capture-recapture data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program. These data sets are characterized by large numbers of sample sites and observers, factors capable of inducing error in the sampling and observation processes. The IPM integrates the data sets by modeling the population abundance as a first-order autoregressive function of the previous year's population abundance and vital rates. BBS counts were modeled as a log-linear function of the annual index of population abundance, observation effects (observer identity and first-survey-year), and overdispersion. Vital rates modeled included adult apparent survival, estimated from a transient Cormack-Jolly-Seber model using MAPS data, and recruitment (surviving hatched birds from the previous season + dispersing adults) estimated as a latent parameter. An assessment of the IPM demonstrated it could recover true parameter values from 200 simulated data sets. The IPM was applied to data sets (1992-2008) of two bird species, gray catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) and wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) in the New England/Mid-Atlantic coastal Bird Conservation Region of the USA. The gray catbird population was relatively stable (trend 0.4\% yr(-1) ), while the wood thrush population nearly halved (trend -4.5\% yr(-1) ) over the 17-yr study period. IPM estimates of population growth rates, adult survival, and detection and residency probabilities were similar and as precise as estimates from the stand-alone BBS and CJS models. A benefit of using the IPM was its ability to estimate the latent recruitment parameter. Annual growth rates for both species correlated more with recruitment than survival, and the relationship for wood thrush was stronger than for gray catbird. The IPM's unified modeling framework facilitates integration of these important data sets. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The effects of forest management on native fauna are of key interest to managers and conservationists. Individual studies have expanded our knowledge of management impacts, but meta-analyses of multiple studies are needed to summarize and integrate findings into a more generalizable form. Most meta-analyses on the effects of tree harvesting have focused on mature forest taxa because of concerns for these species; however, early-successional specialists, such as shrubland birds in the eastern United States, are also of key conservation concern. Using data from 34 studies that examined the effects of silvicultural treatments on bird communities, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effects of tree retention on a suite of bird species reported to be associated with shrubland habitats within the northeastern United States. Of 21 putative shrubland bird species for which we had sufficient sample sizes for analyses, most (62\%) exhibited monotonic declines of density with increasing tree retention, defined as percent basal area or canopy cover retained. Five other species (24\%) exhibited quadratic relationships with tree retention. Finally, three additional species (14\%) considered to be shrubland birds did not exhibit significant relationships with tree retention. We also calculated density estimates of shrubland birds in three categorical classifications of basal area retention corresponding to common management regimes: regeneration harvests with little retention (clearcut and seed-tree methods), regeneration harvests with moderate retention (shelterwoods), and high retention management regimes (commercial thinning, selection methods, no management). Many of the shrubland species had high densities in clearcuts as well as in stands with low levels (5\textendash 25\%) of mature tree retention, and some species had equally high densities in stands with moderate tree retention (30\textendash 70\%), supporting the use of retention forestry approaches, which can provide other benefits associated with mature trees. Overall, our findings provide managers and conservationists with robust, quantitative relationships of shrubland birds with tree retention. Managers can use these quantitative relationships for more detailed planning and evaluation of silvicultural projects, more so than what was feasible using previous findings of shrubland bird responses to discrete silvicultural treatments from disparate studies.},

The inclusive fitness of an individual is defined as the sum of all the effects this individual has on itself and others, with each term multiplied by a relatedness coefficient. However, this quantity does not exist for most evolutionary processes, because biological interactions are typically nonlinear and fitness effects are not additive. Six recent publications, by proponents of inclusive fitness theory and outside observers, agree with our criticism on two mathematical points: in general, there is no inclusive fitness at the level of the individual and natural selection does not lead organisms to maximize inclusive fitness. Here we review the current state of the controversy over inclusive fitness, highlight points of mathematical agreement, and discuss prospects for a way forward.},

In our experiment we developed a model with Maxent (a presence-background SDM) with variables that had a 30-m resolution, and then used the output of the model to restrict the background sampling area for models developed with variables that had a 10-m resolution. According to common measures of model quality, this approach produced better models than both a model developed with the default Maxent background sampling area and a model developed using the conventional approach of resampling environmental data to a common spatial resolution. We then reviewed the ecological meaning of this approach and observed how model mechanics were impacted as restricting the background sampling areas led to background points that had a greater contrast with the presence points, and therefore different environmental characteristics than background points sampled from the default background sampling area.},

Equipped with capable sensors, UAVs can deliver fine spatial resolution data at temporal resolutions defined by the end user.

We studied the density and characteristics of cavities and cavity-bearing trees in three categories of forest in a north-Swedish landscape: clearcuts with tree retention, managed old ({$>$}100 years) forest, and unmanaged old forest. Unmanaged old forests had significantly higher mean density of cavities (2.4 +/- 2.2(SD) ha(-1)) than managed old forest (1.1 +/- 2.1 ha(-1)). On clearcuts the mean cavity density was 0.4 +/- 2.3 ha(-1). Eurasian aspen (Populus tremula) had a higher probability of containing excavated cavities than other tree species. There was a greater variety of entrance hole shapes and a higher proportion of cavities with larger entrances in old forest than on clearcuts. Although studies of breeding success will be necessary to more accurately assess the impact of forest management on cavity-nesting birds, our results show reduced cavity densities in managed forest. To ensure future provision of cavities, managers should retain existing cavity-bearing trees as well as trees suitable for cavity formation, particularly aspen and dead trees.},

The objective of this study was to see if variable canopy retention attenuates environmental change associated with harvesting, consequently maintaining an epixylic community more similar to unharvested stands than single pass harvesting. Environmental conditions and DW characteristics were sampled on 225 DW pieces distributed in 45 permanent plots. Results showed that treatment affected epixylic richness through its impact on canopy openness and DW diameter and decomposition class. Fewer species were found in more open habitats and more species were found on bigger and more decomposed DW. Most epixylic species were more commonly found on the forest floor than on the DW. In conclusion, variable canopy retention harvest offered microclimatic conditions and DW availability and quality more suitable for epixylic species than single pass harvest, which was less suitable for epixylic species.},

  abstract = {The continued provision of old-growth elements in forest landscapes is a critical factor for biodiversity conservation in Central Europe. A well-established method for predicting the potential of forests to maintain biodiversity is to quantify tree-related microhabitat structures (TreMs). Our aim was to predict the TreM abundance and diversity for collectives of TreM-bearing trees; here 15 large trees per plot that were preselected by the largest crown sizes using remote sensing information. TreMs were inventoried on 2085 living trees across 139 plots (each 1 ha) in montane forests of the Black Forest, southwest Germany according to a detailed catalogue comprising 64 different TreM structures. We tested the influence of forest management, forest cover in the surrounding landscape (25 km radius), forest type, the number of standing dead trees, altitude and mean diameter at breast height (DBH) on the abundance and diversity of TreMs on living trees. All plots are managed or have been recently (20-40 yrs) abandoned from management. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to identify the drivers of abundance and diversity of TreMs. The abundance of TreMs borne by the 15 large trees per plot is greater on plots located at higher altitudes. Increasing mean DBH leads to significantly higher abundance and diversity of TreMs. Groups of TreM-bearing trees in monospecific coniferous forests have the highest abundance but those in mixed-coniferous-broadleaved forests have the greatest diversity of TreMs. The occurrences of 11 out of 64 specific TreM structures were related to forest management, forest type, altitude or mean DBH. Large branch holes and buttress cavities increased with mean DBH and were found more frequently in mixed-coniferous-broadleaved forests than in the other forest types. The abundance of epiphytes on TreM bearing trees increased with altitude. This study demonstrates that the average abundance and diversity of TreMs can be predicted with readily available forest attributes. Additionally, the occurrence of specific TreMs could be described with the variation in these selected forest attributes.},

In this study, we investigated whether abundance and richness of tree-related microhabitats (TreMs) differ between habitat trees in clumped and dispersed distributions and whether the abundance of fifteen groups of TreMs is related to tree distribution patterns. To identify habitat trees, we quantified TreMs in temperate mountain forests of Germany. We determined clumping (the Clark\textendash Evans index), size of the convex hull, diameter at breast height, as well as altitude, slope and aspect of sites for their possible influence on TreMs. We additionally determined the difference in TreM abundance and richness among four options of selecting five habitat trees per ha from 15 candidates: (a) the most clumped trees, (b) five randomly selected and dispersed trees, (c) the single tree with highest abundance or richness of TreMs and its four closest neighbors and (d) a ``reference selection'' of five trees with known highest abundance or richness of TreMs irrespective of their distribution. The degree of clumping and the size of the convex hull influenced neither the abundance nor richness of TreMs. The reference selection, option (d), contained more than twice the number of TreMs compared to the most clumped, (a), or random distributions, (b), of five habitat trees, while option (c) assumed an intermediate position. If the goal of habitat tree retention is to maximize stand-level abundance and richness of TreMs, then it is clearly more important to select habitat trees irrespective of their spatial pattern.},

  abstract = {The relative contribution of private and public forest to the conservation of species in mixed-ownership landscapes has often been contentious because management goals vary among owners. This tension can be exacerbated by a lack of understanding about how wildlife use habitats managed by different landowners and the relative value of habitats in having different structures, configurations, and management histories. To address this knowledge gap and enhance science-based conservation planning among different ownerships, we analyzed I habitat selection by 53 GPS-tagged California spotted owls across multiple temporal scales within mixed-ownership landscapes in the Sierra Nevada. At a fine temporal scale, step-selection function analysis of hourly locations collected by GPS tags suggested that foraging spotted owls selected closed-canopy, larger-tree forest (Quadratic Mean Diameter \{[\}QMD] {$>$}= 33 cm, canopy cover {$>$}= 60\%). Point selection function (PSF) analysis based on single nightly locations suggested that spotted owls selected a broader range of forest conditions including selection of forests having intermediate sized trees and intermediate canopy cover (QMD 28-33 cm, canopy cover {$>$}= 50\%), and the strength of selection for these forest conditions increased in the less frequently used areas of home ranges. The PSF also suggested that spotted owls selected areas with relatively high cover type heterogeneity that included a mix of seral stages, except in the core of their home range where they selected relatively spatially homogenous forests characterized by large trees and closed canopy. Spotted owl home ranges increased in size with increasing elevation and cover type heterogeneity, and decreased in size with forest characterized by intermediate-sized trees. Collectively, these results indicate that landscapes having forest patches characterized by either intermediate or large-sized trees, both with high canopy cover, likely constitute the important foraging habitat for California spotted owls in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests. However, selection for any one particular cover type was not sufficiently strong for us to infer selection of individual landownership types, in spite of differences in forest conditions among ownerships. Collectively, our findings suggest that privately-owned lands used in our study may harbor more suitable spotted owl foraging habitat than previously recognized. Finally, given the importance of understanding the relationship between landowner management priorities and the resultant pattern of vegetation on lands with different ownerships, the development of forest management strategies relevant for broad-scale conservation of the Sierra Nevada forest will benefit from effective collaboration between forest managers, landowners, and research organizations.},

  abstract = {Stump sprouts are an important form of regeneration for a number of species in the southern Appalachians, especially the oaks (Quercus spp.). Alternative regeneration systems to clearcutting such as shelterwood and leave-tree systems are being implemented in many hardwood stands in the Appalachians. However, the effects of these alternative silvicultural systems on stump sprouts are not known. Therefore. we evaluated the impact of three silvicultural systems: a clearcut, leave-tree, and shelterwood on stump sprouting. These treatments were implemented in seven stands in Virginia and West Virginia in the Appalachian Plateau (AP) and Ridge and Valley (RV) physiographic provinces. The stands were even-aged oak dominated Appalachian hardwood stands with ages ranging from 62 to 100 years. Species were placed into six groups: (1) red oak (Quercus spp.), (2) chestnut oak (Q prinus L.), (3) white oak (Q alba L.) and hickory (Carya spp.), (4) red maple (Acer rubrum L.), (5) mixed mesic, and (6) midstory groups. Partial harvesting also reduced the number of sprouts per stump for the red oak group and red maple. Sprouting probabilities were generally less in the Appalachian Plateau than the Ridge and Valley, particularly for the oaks (Quercus spp.). Partial harvesting systems decreased sprouting in both physiographic provinces. However, the sprouting in specific species groups varied between the two physiographic provinces. In the Ridge and Valley, the highest sprouting rates were in the clearcut for the red oak (60\%), chestnut oak (77\%), white oak-hickory (26\%), and midstory (33\%) species groups. Red maple sprouting was highest in the leave-tree (67\%) in the Ridge and Valley. The mixed mesic and midstory groups were only reduced in the Ridge and Valley. Sprouting was negatively correlated with residual basal area for the red oak group, chestnut oak, and red maple. For the all oak species except white oak, sprouting was reduced by about 2\% for every 1m(2)/ha increase in residual basal area. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Therefore, novel economic valuation schemes must be developed in order to support conservation programs and mitigate biodiversity loss. Here, we assess the economic implications of retention forestry practices and create a habitat network in a mixed-montane forest in Southwestern Germany. We applied a simulation-optimization approach for i) evaluation of retention forestry practices applied in the region, ii) creation of forest reserves with a minimum eligible area for biodiversity conservation and establishing a connecting corridor with minimum cost, and iii) allocation of deadwood islands inside the connecting corridor with minimum cost. The average opportunity cost arising from retention forestry practices amounted to 1795 EUFt/ha by leaving a minimum deadwood volume of 35 m(3)/ha and 2.5-5 habitat trees/ha. The optimized plan for establishing a habitat network would reduce the net present value (NPV) of forest management between 3.7\% and 4.2\%, and the novel design for the allocation of deadwood islands would impose a marginal reduction ( {$<$} 1\%) to the NPV. We conclude that the creation of a habitat network for biodiversity conservation can be realized with the minimum trade-off to forest management profitability.},

Climate change is expected to modify ecological processes and amplify disturbances, compromising the provisioning of multiple ecosystem services. Here we investigate the impacts of climate change and forest management on the abundance of tree microhabitats and forest birds as biodiversity proxies, using an integrated modelling approach. To perform our analysis, we calibrated tree microhabitat and bird abundance in a forest landscape in Southwestern Germany, and coupled them with a climate sensitive forest growth model. Our results show generally positive impacts of climate warming and higher harvesting intensity on bird abundance, with up to 30\% increase. Conversely, climate change and wood removals above 5\% of the standing volume led to a loss of tree microhabitats. A diversified set of management regimes with different harvesting intensities applied in a landscape scale was required to balance this trade-off. For example, to maximize the expected bird abundance (up to 11\%) and to avoid tree microhabitat abundance loss of {$>$}20\% necessitates setting aside 10.2\% of the forest area aside and application of harvesting intensities {$<$} 10.4\% of the standing volume. We conclude that promoting forest structural complexity by diversifying management regimes across the landscape will be key to maintain forest biodiversity in temperate forests under climate change.

The loss of insect diversity may disrupt ecosystem functioning and affect the provision of important ecosystem goods and services in the future. Here we propose a novel approach for the implementation of conservation policies, by optimally allocating forest reserves and deadwood islands under multiple sources of uncertainty and minimizing economic risk. We use the saproxylic beetle Lucanus cervus as umbrella species, requiring that deadwood islands were spaced within its dispersal capacity. We show that current management and conservation practices are increasingly inefficient under changing environmental conditions and that the consideration of uncertainty requires a major expansion of conservation areas. Moreover, our results indicate that a strong diversification of management regimes, with a focus on selection forest systems, is required to reduce economic risk of forest management.

  abstract = {Given the importance of knowledge of species distribution for conservation and climate change management, continuous and progressive evaluation of the statistical models predicting species distributions is necessary. Current models are evaluated in terms of ecological theory used, the data model accepted and the statistical methods applied. Focus is restricted to Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Generalised Additive Models (GAM). Certain currently unused regression methods are reviewed for their possible application to species modelling. A review of recent papers suggests that ecological theory is rarely explicitly considered. Current theory and results support species responses to environmental variables to be unimodal and often skewed though process-based theory is often lacking. Many studies fail to test for unimodal or skewed responses and straight-line relationships are often fitted without justification. Data resolution (size of sampling unit) determines the nature of the environmental niche models that can be fitted. A synthesis of differing ecophysiological ideas and the use of biophysical processes models could improve the selection of predictor variables. A better conceptual framework is needed for selecting variables. Comparison of statistical methods is difficult. Predictive success is insufficient and a test of ecological realism is also needed. Evaluation of methods needs artificial data, as there is no knowledge about the true relationships between variables for field data. However, use of artificial data is limited by lack of comprehensive theory. Three potentially new methods are reviewed. Quantile regression (QR) has potential and a strong theoretical justification in Liebig's law of the minimum. Structural equation modelling (SEM) has an appealing conceptual framework for testing causality but has problems with curvilinear relationships. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) intended to examine spatial non-stationarity of ecological processes requires further evaluation before being used. Synthesis and applications: explicit theory needs to be incorporated into species response models used in conservation. For example, testing for unimodal skewed responses should be a routine procedure. Clear statements of the ecological theory used, the nature of the data model and sufficient details of the statistical method are needed for current models to be evaluated. New statistical methods need to be evaluated for compatibility with ecological theory before use in applied ecology. Some recent work with artificial data suggests the combination of ecological knowledge and statistical skill is more important than the precise statistical method used. The potential exists for a synthesis of current species modelling approaches based on their differing ecological insights not their methodology. Crown Copyright \textcopyright{} 2006.},

In this study, our aim is to develop a non-invasive method of classifying respiratory sounds that are recorded by an electronic stethoscope and the audio recording software that uses various machine learning algorithms. In order to store respiratory sounds on a computer, we developed a cost-effective and easy-to-use electronic stethoscope that can be used with any device. Using this device, we recorded 17,930 lung sounds from 1630 subjects. We employed two types of machine learning algorithms; mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features in a support vector machine (SVM) and spectrogram images in the convolutional neural network (CNN). Since using MFCC features with a SVM algorithm is a generally accepted classification method for audio, we utilized its results to benchmark the CNN algorithm. We prepared four data sets for each CNN and SVM algorithm to classify respiratory audio: (1) healthy versus pathological classification; (2) rale, rhonchus, and normal sound classification; (3) singular respiratory sound type classification; and (4) audio type classification with all sound types. Accuracy results of the experiments were; (1) CNN 86\%, SVM 86\%, (2) CNN 76\%, SVM 75\%, (3) CNN 80\%, SVM 80\%, and (4) CNN 62\%, SVM 62\%, respectively. As a result, we found out that spectrogram image classification with CNN algorithm works as well as the SVM algorithm, and given the large amount of data, CNN and SVM machine learning algorithms can accurately classify and pre-diagnose respiratory audio.},

Here, we evaluated the suitability of airborne lidar data in comparison with aerial photographs and field surveys for modelling the distribution of an endangered and cryptic forest species, the hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia). The study was conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park of southeast Germany. Subsequently, a prediction map for conservation planning was generated for a large area, which encompassed the National Park. We examined the utility of lidar data for generating a hazel grouse distribution model by using machine learning (boosted regression trees), and then compared the results to variables derived from field surveys and aerial photographs, both separately and in combination. The cross-validated discrimination ability of the model was slightly higher when using lidar data (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.79) compared to models using aerial photographs (AUC, 0.75) or field survey data (AUC, 0.78). The predictive performance consistently increased when combining the predictors from different sources, with an AUC of 0.86 being produced in the model combining all three data sources. The three data sources complemented one another, with each data source probably having an advantage at deriving one of three key aspects of the hazel grouse habitat, namely, vertically well-structured forest stands, horizontally mixed successional vegetation stages, and certain deciduous trees as food resources such as mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). In addition, the diverse lidar metrics might be applied to simultaneously characterize vertically and horizontally well-structured forest stands.We conclude that public available airborne lidar data are a viable source for creating habitat suitability maps for large areas and may have increased utility for detecting forest characteristics and valuable wildlife habitats.},

However, understanding relationships between faunal diversity and measurable ecosystem quantities, such as heterogeneity and productivity, across continental scales can be complicated by disparate methods. We developed standardized approaches using lidar data and spectral greenness data (via NOVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from 637 sampling plots across four sites in North America, Europe, and Asia to test the local effects of habitat heterogeneity and productivity on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of breeding bird assemblages using boosted generalized additive models. Our results revealed the 3-D (three dimensional) vegetation structure (horizontal and vertical) to be of similar importance as NDVI in multiple biodiversity measures, and the importance of 3-D structure was higher for functional and phylogenetic biodiversity measures than for taxonomic measures. We found congruent responses between functional and phylogenetic diversity; however, patterns of taxonomic diversity differed from those of functional/phylogenetic diversity for most predictors. For example, NDVI had positive relationships with taxonomic diversity, but negative relationships with functional/ phylogenetic diversity. The effect of canopy density on taxonomic diversity was generally bell-shaped, whereas the relationship was U-shaped for functional and phylogenetic diversity. As a result, this study supports a silviculture strategy with a high variety of canopy densities and vertical variabilities across forest stands to create maximum benefits for regional biodiversity. Here, early succession stands and closed stands sustain functionally-rich bird assemblages, while stands with a medium canopy density promote species-rich assemblages.},

Recent research and application suggest that retention of mature forest elements (retention forestry), including unharvested patches (or aggregates) within larger harvested units, can benefit biodiversity compared to clearcutting. However, it is unclear whether these benefits can be generalized among the diverse taxa and biomes in which retention forestry is practiced. Lack of comparability in methods for sampling and analyzing responses to timber harvest and edge creation presents a challenge to synthesis. We used a consistent methodology (similarly spaced plots or traps along transects) to investigate responses of vascular plants and ground-active beetles to aggregated retention at replicate sites in each of four temperate and boreal forest types on three continents: Douglas-fir forests in Washington, USA; aspen forests in Minnesota, USA; spruce forests in Sweden; and wet eucalypt forests in Tasmania, Australia. We assessed (1) differences in local (plot-scale) species richness and composition between mature (intact) and regenerating (previously harvested) forest; (2) the lifeboating function of aggregates (capacity to retain species of unharvested forest); and whether intact forests and aggregates (3) are susceptible to edge effects and (4) influence the adjacent regenerating forest. Intact and harvested forests differed in composition but not richness of plants and beetles. The magnitude of this difference was generally similar among regions, but there was considerable heterogeneity of composition within and among replicate sites. Aggregates within harvest units were effective at lifeboating for both plant and beetle communities. Edge effects were uncommon even within the aggregates. In contrast, effects of forest influence on adjacent harvested areas were common and as strong for aggregates as for larger blocks of intact forest. Our results provide strong support for the widespread application of aggregated retention in boreal and temperate forests. The consistency of pattern in four very different regions of the world suggests that, for forest plants and beetles, responses to aggregated retention are likely to apply more widely. Our results suggest that through strategic placement of aggregates, it is possible to maintain the natural heterogeneity and biodiversity of mature forests managed for multiple objectives.},

At each site, we established ten plots of each of four types: burnt unharvested forest and in paired plots in nearby harvested areas, as well as in undisturbed forest and in paired plots in nearby harvested areas. Although the regeneration was less speciose and dominated by wet sclerophyll species, we found a strong relationship between the floristic composition of the regeneration in harvested areas and that of nearby undisturbed forest. We found no significant difference in the floristic composition of the regeneration between the harvested areas adjacent to either burnt unharvested forest or undisturbed forest. This suggests that the undisturbed forest in aggregates and coupe edges was not a significant seed source for the initial regeneration. There was a slight difference between the floristics of regeneration in the burnt unharvested forest and the harvested areas, with reduced species richness in harvested treatments at three of six sites.

  abstract = {Most silvicultural methods have been developed with the principal aim of ensuring adequate regeneration of commercial tree species after harvesting. Much less effort has been directed towards developing methods that benefit the re-establishment of all forest biodiversity. The concept of `forest influence' relates the probability of species re-establishment to the distance from mature forest. This idea is central to contemporary retention forestry practices as well as connectivity theory in natural landscape management. Some species from all major forest biodiversity groups respond to forest influence following harvesting, however, the temporal and spatial scales of forest influence are mostly poorly known. This paper reviews global knowledge of mechanisms and scales at which forest influence operates, and shows that these are highly variable. Important general factors and mechanisms that underlie the ability of organisms to re-establish include qualities of retained elements, dispersal capacity, suitability of habitat conditions, and interspecific interactions, all of which may vary with distance from intact mature forest. Forest influence may enable species to persist in harvested areas through buffering of microclimate, and/or assist re-colonisation via proximity to source populations or essential habitat elements. Although foresters have often applied a ``rule of thumb\{''\} that the extent of forest influence is within one tree height of mature forest, existing scientific literature provides little evidence of a universal relationship between canopy height of retained forest and re-establishment success. One-tree-height-from-retention guidelines can help plan harvest layouts, but only as long as plans allow for variation in re-establishment success among species and groups. The evidence from this review is that variability in harvest layouts will positively benefit biodiversity conservation in managed forest landscapes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We investigated the Eucalyptus regnans forests of the Victorian Central Highlands in south-eastern Australia, where several extensive wildfires in the last century have left little mature forest. We assessed the extent to which the floristic composition and a suite of habitat-related structural variables could be explained by two forest inventory GIS variables (percentage senescence and site productivity) and whether explanatory capacity improved from inclusion of additional environmental variables (climate, soils, topography, structure and spatial location). Results showed that the floristic composition was weakly related to productivity, but not to percentage senescence. Four habitat-related structural variables were positively related to percentage senescence (density of old-growth eucalypts, the quadratic mean diameter (QMD) of both live and dead eucalypts, and the maximum eucalypt form class (a proxy for tree hollows)) while the volume of CWD had a marginally significant positive relationship. Three structural variables were related to productivity (the maximum eucalypt form class, the QMD of dead understorey trees and of dead eucalypts). However, in all cases the explanatory power of percentage senescence and productivity was weak (proportion of deviance explained by the models {$<$} 0.3). Inclusion of the other environmental variables did not substantially improve explanatory power in any case. Our results suggest that there is a high degree of stochasticity driving floristic and structural composition within these forests, making the detection of most mature forest values difficult without site visits. There may be some limited capacity for the presence of senescent trees visible in aerial photographs to highlight stands more likely to contain habitat trees, but there was no relationship with floristic maturity. Our results also suggest that more productive sites do not have substantially greater habitat values, indicating that the current timber harvesting approach of prioritising the harvest of stands on more productive sites is unlikely to have negative consequences for biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Microclimatic forest influence (edge effects into open or regenerating areas) occurs within harvested forest , but the depth and magnitude may change depending on the design of the harvested area. This is an important consideration for managers, because gradients in microclimate can significant affect the ability of species to recolonise following disturbance. One harvesting method that can increase the amount of forest influence is aggregated retention. This technique involves leaving groups of trees (aggregates) within the harvested area, thus increasing the amount of regenerating forest that is near to an edge and therefore under forest influence. However, differences in the scale of forest influence generated from aggregates compared to unlogged forests surrounding harvested areas have not been tested. Understanding the ability of retained aggregates to generate forest influence is important in designing and implementing aggregated retention harvesting practices. This study tested whether retained aggregates generated similar levels of forest influence as mature forest surrounding harvested areas. Microclimatic forest influence was examined by monitoring spatial changes in air temperature and relative humidity along transects running from within standing mature forest into harvested forest. Intact forest and aggregate transects were located in the direction of maximum expected forest influence (south-facing edges). Results showed that forest influence was mostly similar in both depth and magnitude regardless of the type of forest from which it was generated. Temporal examination of forest influence showed that it changed throughout the day and across the year, with peaks in magnitude occurring during the middle of the day, and in months close to the equinoxes. Shade derived from standing trees was a potential driver of temporal patterns in microclimatic forest influence. At its peak magnitude, the microclimatic forest influence observed will likely have significant impacts on habitat suitability and thus, presumably, species recolonisation after disturbance. Results indicated that aggregated retention is an effective method for generating forest influence within harvested areas. Therefore, aggregated retention has the potential to be a valuable harvesting technique to alter microcli-mate and have beneficial impacts on the recovery of harvested forests.},

  abstract = {A major aim of sustainable forest management is the maintenance or recolonisation of harvested areas by species that were present pre-disturbance. Forest influence (a type of edge effect that focuses on the effect of mature forests on adjacent disturbed forest) is considered to be an important factor that contributes to the ability of mature forest species to re-colonise disturbed areas. Forest influence occurs in two main ways by: (1) by providing a source of propagules or individuals for recolonisation; and (2) by its influence on the biotic and abiotic conditions of the disturbed forest. This study focuses on forest influence's impact on microclimate conditions of adjacent disturbed areas regenerating after harvesting. In particular, the study investigates whether microclimate within a regenerating forest changes with increasing distance from a mature forest edge, and whether the magnitude of microclimatic change varies over diurnal, seasonal and successional time scales. Results of the study showed that the microclimate of regenerating forests is affected by the distance to a standing mature forest. Temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, and the short-term fluctuations of these microclimate parameters were influenced by nearby mature forest. In addition, the study found that the magnitude of forest influence changes over diurnal, seasonal and successional time scales. For example, it was discovered that forest influence is greatest during the middle of the day, during the summer months when solar heating is greatest and on hot windy days. Critically; the impact of forest influence peaked around 27 years after disturbance in the areas studied, with less influence shortly after disturbance. We speculate this is due to lower levels of midday shading in the 7 year old forest. Forest influence on microclimate persisted in regeneration areas that were harvested 45 years ago, although the magnitude and importance of the effect was low. We conclude that proximity to mature forest stands (forests influence) impacts the microclimate of forests regenerating after disturbance, although the response is quite variable through time. Our results provide insight into the role of microclimate on the ability of mature forest species to successfully recolonise after disturbance. Management practices, such as aggregated retention and other forms of retention forestry, which increase the proportion of harvested area under forest influence, may provide a mechanism to promote the re-colonisation of mature-forest species.

  abstract = {Variable retention (VR) is increasingly being used as an alternative to clearcutting in temperate and boreal forests. VR is an approach to harvesting and regeneration that aims to improve biodiversity and social outcomes over the subsequent rotation, while continuing to meet silvicultural and economic imperatives. Aggregated retention, a form of VR in which patches of unharvested forest are retained at harvest, has been used operationally in Tasmania's public oldgrowth wet eucalypt forests since 2007. Development of aggregated retention required articulation of goals and guidelines for implementation in the Tasmanian context. An extensive research and monitoring program, as well as close liaison between research, management and operational staff, facilitated the adaptive management process. These arrangements aimed to overcome operational challenges and ensure that silvicultural practices were consistent with the available science and expert judgement relating to biodiversity outcomes. The three over-arching ecological objectives for VR silviculture in Tasmania were: Objective 1, facilitating rapid re-establishment of mature forest biodiversity in the harvested area by providing forest influence over the majority of the harvested area; Objective 2, ensuring the retention (2a) and integrity (2b) of biological legacies; and Objective 3, creating favourable conditions for plant regeneration and animal habitat in the harvested area, with connectivity between retained forest edges and the regenerating stand. An individual VR harvest operation ('coupe') needed to meet all three objectives in order to receive an overall rating as having delivered the ecological goals of VR. Twelve criteria were then established for assessing attainment of specific aspects of these objectives in each VR coupe, and metrics were developed to score harvest outcomes against each of these criteria. We present the results from 33 coupes that were harvested and regenerated between 2004 and 2010. Coupes harvested early in the development of VR usually rated well against Objectives 1 and 2a, less well against Objective 2b and poorly against Objective 3. Broadcast regeneration burns are integral to successful eucalypt regeneration. However, they can be more challenging to contain within harvested areas in aggregated retention coupes compared to clearcuts, and initially there were unacceptable levels of fire damage to retained trees, while wide firebreaks damaged soils. Changes in coupe design, in firebreaking practices, and in regeneration burning procedures resulted in coupes rating well against all objectives by 2010. The articulation of clearly defined, documented and measurable ecological objectives accompanied by a transparent assessment process was a key component of the adaptive management process that resulted in successful operational implementation of this new silvicultural system. Elements of this approach could be adapted for application in any forest type worldwide. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The recognition that biodiversity conservation requires more than a system of reserves has led to the need to consider the outcomes of land management actions, such as timber harvesting, in the matrix land outside reserves. The design of harvesting systems can be guided by the natural disturbance regime, which in Tasmania's lowland wet eucalypt forests is infrequent, intense wildfire. Clearfell, burn and sow silviculture has been used since the 1960s for harvesting these forests but, while this system is practical and effectively regenerates eucalypts in harvested coupes, it is predicted to lead to losses at the coupe level of late-successional species and structures that would survive into stands regenerating following natural wildfire. Variable retention silviculture is thus currently being implemented as an alternative to clearfelling in wet old-growth forest on public land (state forest) in Tasmania. In contrast to clearfelling, variable retention has the explicit ecological goal of maintaining some species, habitats and structural legacies from the pre-harvest forest into the harvested and regenerating stand. This paper synthesises biodiversity findings from the Warra Silvicultural Systems Trial (SST), established in 1997, and demonstrates that aggregated retention is the optimal form of variable retention for ensuring coupe-scale persistence (`lifeboating') of mature-forest biodiversity. In addition to providing retained forest, aggregates are also designed to facilitate recolonisation of harvested areas by mature-forest species (`forest influence'), and to provide connectivity across the forest stand. In the last few years, more than 50 aggregated-retention coupes have been harvested in mature forest across Tasmania. Development and implementation of variable retention in Tasmania is an example of active adaptive management, which we describe in relation to five steps for a formalised adaptive management program, indicating how ecological criteria are incorporated in operational guidelines for implementation of aggregated retention. \textcopyright{} 2011 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Aggregated retention, in which patches of trees (aggregates) remain unlogged within larger harvested units, was first applied commercially in 1986. A primary goal was to maintain greater diversity of forest-dependent species through harvest, relative to conventional clearcutting. Despite its global application, the long-term benefits for biodiversity and the comparative responses of disparate taxonomic groups to aggregated retention are largely unknown. A critical knowledge gap relates to the role of `forest influence' whether and to what extent aggregates affect biodiversity in neighboring harvested areas. We sampled plants, beetles, and spiders/harvestmen in the world's three oldest aggregated-retention sites (21-26 years old), matched with three recently harvested sites (5-8 years old). For each taxonomic group, we compared species composition between undisturbed aggregates and regenerating forests to assess the `lifeboating' function of aggregates. For each group, we also modeled changes in species composition, and in the numbers of aggregate- and regeneration-affiliated species, with distance from the aggregate edge into the regenerating forest along transects at north-facing edges. For all three taxa, species composition differed between aggregates and regenerating forests in both older and recent sites, confirming the long-term effectiveness of aggregates for lifeboating. The compositional difference between habitats was significantly greater at recent than at older sites for plants, but not for invertebrates. Plants and spiders/harvestmen responded to forest influence, with a marginal response for beetles. Responses for plants and spiders generally manifested as increased numbers of aggregate-affiliated species and decreased numbers of regeneration-affiliated species in regenerating areas closer to edges. Our results indicate that aggregated retention has short- and long-term benefits for biodiversity reflecting both the lifeboating and forest-influence functions of aggregates. However, variation in the responses of plants, beetles and spiders suggests that these benefits cannot be generalized among taxa. We advocate broader application of aggregated retention in forests managed for timber production and encourage managers to incorporate the benefits of forest influence in harvest designs by arranging aggregates to reduce average distances from harvested areas to unlogged habitats.

Edge effects into disturbed forests have been identified as having important impacts on the re-colonisation of both flora and fauna. In a study system located in southern Tasmania, we investigated whether bryophyte colonisation of harvested forests was impacted by edge effects from a standing mature forest (forest influence) and if this effect persisted through time. We tested this by placing transects across a mature/regeneration forest boundary, then recording bryophyte community composition from the ground and coarse woody debris at set distances from the edge. A chronosequence of harvested forest ages (similar to 7, similar to 27 and similar to 45 years post harvesting) was used to determine if forest influence persisted through time. Models generated by non-linear canonical analysis of principal coordinates (NCAP) predicted the depth of forest influence, and `distances among centroids' inferred the magnitude of forest influence. Results showed that bryophyte composition in regeneration forests responded to distance from a mature edge. Locations closer to a mature edge had greater similarity in community composition with mature forests. This study also showed that the response of bryophytes to forests influence persisted though time, even after canopy closure. Overall, mature forest species tended to be aided and early seral species restricted by forest influence. However, responses were species-specific and varied with forest age. The colonisation success of mature forest associated species was improved by forest influence; these species are typically at most at risk of being eliminated after disturbance. This result highlights the need to consider edge effects in management. The impact of forest influence on bryophytes therefore has the potential to be used in the design of areas to be harvested.

Landsat data are systematically collected and archived following a global acquisition strategy. The provision of free, robust data products since 2008 has spurred a renaissance of interest in Landsat and resulted in an increasingly widespread use of Landsat time series (LTS) for multitemporal characterizations. The science and applications capacity has developed steadily since 1972, with the increase in sophistication offered over time incorporated into Landsat processing and analysis practices. With the successful launch of Landsat-8, the continuity of measures at scales of particular relevance to management and scientific activities is ensured in the short term. In particular, forest monitoring benefits from LTS, whereby a baseline of conditions can be interrogated for both abrupt and gradual changes and attributed to different drivers. Such benefits are enabled by data availability, analysis-ready image products, increased computing power and storage, as well as sophisticated image processing approaches. In this review, we present the status of remote sensing of forests and forest dynamics using LTS, including issues related to the sensors, data availability, data preprocessing, variables used in LTS, analysis approaches, and validation issues.

Understanding this relationship for highly-mobile species requires documenting their responses to spatiotemporal variability of resources. To that end, characterizing movement behaviors and resource distributions using the principles of habitat connectivity facilitates coordinated landscape planning efforts within highly modified landscapes. Objectives and methods We tracked locations and movements for 156 dunlin (Calidris alpina) and 109 long-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus) overwintering in two regions with distinct water distributions in California's Central Valley. We then compared residency rates, functional connectivity to other regions, and associations between movement distances and average habitat availability and structural connectivity of habitat at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Results A widespread yet highly variable regional water distribution was associated with lower residency rates and substantially higher functional connectivity to nearby regions when compared to a stable regional water distribution characterized by a large, contiguous wetland complex. Longer movements were associated with decreasing average availability and spatial aggregation of surface water. Movement models suggested shorebirds primarily responded to habitat availability at smaller scales ({$<$} 10 km) and structural connectivity at larger scales ({$>$}= 10 km). Conclusions Differences in movement behaviors suggested that wintering shorebirds will avoid long distance movements and remain resident within a wetland region when possible. Conservation and management efforts should reliably flood individual wetlands and agricultural lands from November to April and prioritize locations that maximize structural wetland connectivity and limit spatiotemporal variability of surface water throughout the Central Valley.},

Evaluating habitat quality and understory composition across complex landscapes remains a challenge for forest and wildlife managers, but is essential for ensuring the stability of vulnerable species. In this study we investigate whether forest stand structure, as measured by airborne laser scanning (ALS), can be used to predict the abundance and fruit production (fruit count) for Canada buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis), huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), and saskatoon (Amelanchier alnifolia) shrubs in southwest Alberta, Canada. We combine ALS, climate, and terrain data to build random forest models of species abundance and fruit productivity, trained on data from 322 field plots. ALS data was processed into a suite of stand structure variables, under the hypothesis that models incorporating stand structure will be more powerful than models without for describing understory shrub abundance and reproduction (fruit productivity). ALS data improved model fit for saskatoon and huckleberry abundance models, with total explained variance (r2) ranging from 37.6 to 59.4\%. Inclusion of ALS data improved explained variance between 0\% and 16\%, suggesting that saskatoon and huckleberry in particular were associated with overstory vegetation structure. Despite the importance of ALS in further improving explanation of shrub abundance and fruit production, terrain factors were the dominant factor affecting regional and local variation in species abundance and fruit production.},

Mathematical models provide partial descriptions of these processes; inference is the process of using the data to obtain a more complete description of the stochastic processes. Wildlife and ecological scientists have become increasingly concerned with the conditional nature of model-based inference: what if the model is wrong? Over the last 2 decades, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) has been widely and increasingly used in wildlife statistics for 2 related purposes, first for model choice and second to quantify model uncertainty. We argue that for the second of these purposes, the Bayesian paradigm provides the natural framework for describing uncertainty associated with model choice and provides the most easily communicated basis for model weighting. Moreover, Bayesian arguments provide the sole justification for interpreting model weights (including AIC weights) as coherent (mathematically self consistent) model probabilities. This interpretation requires treating the model as an exact description of the data-generating mechanism. We discuss the implications of this assumption, and conclude that more emphasis is needed on model checking to provide confidence in the quality of inference.},

Conservation management strategies could bemore effective if this association was further clarified; however, defining canopy structure from the ground can be laborious and subjective. We used light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data to create canopy height models that provide accurate objective data on the vertical and horizontal canopy structure throughout the extent of our study area in south-central Indiana's Morgan\textendash{} Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. In addition, we used LIDAR data to construct digital terrain models to derive topographic metrics for our study area. We combined these data with data from ground-level surveys and created habitat models to determine which variables best predict cerulean warbler occurrence and density. Model subsets containing only LIDAR-derived variables performed better than model subsets containing variables derived only from ground-level surveys. The top occurrence model indicated that cerulean warblers defended areas that were associated with northeast facing slopes, lower elevations, gentler slopes, and greater hickory (Carya spp.) basal area (m2/ha). The top density models indicated that the high- use areas for cerulean warblers were associated with steeper slopes, lower total basal area (m2/ha), fewer large trees (?53cm diameter at breast height), greater white oak (Quercus alba) basal area (m2/ha), and contained a homogeneous horizontal and vertical canopy structure. Conservation managers should consider silvicultural practices that promote old growth oak\textendash hickory (Quercus spp.\textendash Carya spp.) forests on mesic slopes.

  abstract = {1. Variable-retention harvest is widely recognized as an alternative to more intensive methods such as clear-cutting. However, present information is inadequate to judge the impact of variable retention on biodiversity of indigenous forest organisms intolerant of canopy removal, such as forest-inhabiting bryophytes. 2. We examined how bryophyte species cover, richness, diversity and composition change with time in response to a broad range of dispersed retention harvest treatments (2\% \{[\}clear-cut], 10\%, 20\%, 50\%, 75\% retention of original basal area) contrasted with uncut controls \{[\}100\% retention]) in broadleaf deciduous, mixedwood and conifer-dominated boreal forests in North West Alberta, Canada. Bryophytes were studied in 432 permanent sample plots within 72 compartments before harvest and at 3, 6 and 11years after harvest. 3. Clear-cut and lower (10\% and 20\%) retention levels resulted in lower cover and richness of bryophytes than in unharvested control compartments in mixed and conifer-dominated forests, but less so in deciduous-dominated forests, which generally supported low cover and richness. Species composition in each forest type varied along the gradient of harvesting intensity; clear-cuts and lower levels of retention supported similar composition, as did control plots and those representing higher retention levels. Over time, the retention harvest treatments became more similar to uncut controls. 4. Synthesis and applications. Variable-retention harvests can better maintain bryophyte biodiversity in managed boreal mixedwood forests, as compared to clear-cuts. We found the efficacy of retention harvest scaled with harvest intensity. Higher levels of retention better moderated the negative impacts of harvesting on bryophyte assemblages across all forest types. Our results suggest, however, that even 10\% retention will facilitate faster post-harvest recovery of bryophytes, as compared to clear-cutting.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to gain insights into the reproducibility of light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived vegetation metrics for multiple acquisitions carried out on the same day, where we can assume that forest and terrain conditions at a given location have not changed. Four overlapping lines were flown over a forested area in Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Forty-six 0.04-ha plots were systematically established, and commonly derived variables were extracted from first and last returns, including height-related metrics, cover estimates, return intensities, and absolute scan angles. Plot-level metrics from each LiDAR pass were then compared using multivariate repeated-measures analysis-of-variance tests. Results indicate that, while the number of returns was significantly different between the four overlapping flight lines, most LiDAR-derived first return vegetation height metrics were not. First return maximum height and overstory cover, however, were significantly different and varied between flight lines by an average of approximately 2\% and 4\%, respectively. First return intensities differed significantly between overpasses where sudden changes in the metric occurred without any apparent explanation; intensity should only be used following calibration. With the exception of the standard deviation of height, all second return metrics were significantly different between flight lines. Despite these minor differences, the study demonstrates that, when the LiDAR sensor, settings, and data acquisition flight parameters remain constant, and time-related forest dynamics are not factors, LiDAR-derived metrics of the same location provide stable and repeatable measures of the forest structure, confirming the suitability of LiDAR for forest monitoring.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that light availability strongly influences longleaf pine seedling growth. In this study, the relationship between spatial structure of a longleaf pine forest and spatial pattern of understory light availability were investigated by comparing three retention harvest treatments: single-tree, small-group, large-group, and an uncut control. The harvests retained similar residual basal area but the spatial patterns of the residual trees differed. Hemispherical photographs were taken at 300 stations to calculate gap light index (GLI), an estimate of understory light availability. Stand-level mean, variation, and spatial distribution of GLI were determined for each treatment. By aggregating residual trees, stand mean GLI increased by 20\%, as well as its spatial variation. Spatial autocorrelation of GLI increased as the size of the canopy gaps increased and the gaps were better defined; thus, the predictability of GLI was enhanced. The ranges of detrended semivariograms were increased from the control to the large-group harvest indicating the spatial patterns of understory GLI became coarser textured. Our results demonstrated that aggregated canopy structure of longleaf pine forest will facilitate longleaf pine seedling regeneration.},

These models often rely oil remotely sensed data in a forest resource inventory (FRI). However, the level of detail and (or) the accuracy of a FRI may be insufficient to accurately predict habitat suitability for forest birds. We tested if detailed vegetation measurements created habitat suitability models with better predictive power than models that used FRI data alone and if rough estimates of shrub cover were sufficient to supplement FRI data to create models with similar predictive power. For 28 species of forest birds, we found that less of the variation in abundance and (or) occurrence (\% deviance explained) could be explained by models using FRI data alone (34\% +/- 2\%) than by models using detailed vegetation information (40\% +/- 2\%). However, when shrub density rank was included with FRI data, we found no difference in the deviance explained by the two model sets (39\% +/- 2\% vs. 40\% +/- 2\%). The best-fitting models containing the same vegetation parameters but using different methods of vegetation sampling were similar. These results suggest that coarse habitat classification schemes may be as effective in describing the major variance in bird community structure in the boreal forest as detailed vegetation inventory data.},

  abstract = {Conserving species biodiversity demands decisive and effective action. Effective action requires an understanding of species population dynamics. Therefore, robust measures which track temporal changes in species populations are needed. This need, however, must be balanced against the scale at which population change is being assessed. Advances in citizen science and remote sensing technology have heralded an era of ``big unstructured data'' for biodiversity conservation. However, the value of big unstructured data for assessing changes in species populations, and effectively guiding conservation management has not been rigorously assessed. This can be achieved only by benchmarking big unstructured data against high-quality structured datasets, and ensuring the latter are not lost through an over-emphasis on ``big data''. Here, we illustrate the current trend to disproportionately prioritise data quantity over data quality and highlight the discrepancy in global availability between both data types. We propose a research agenda to test whether this trend will result in a net decrease of useful knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We exemplify this by examining the availability of big unstructured data vs standardised data using data from global repositories on birds as an example. We share experiences from the data collation exercise needed to develop the Australian Threatened Species Index. We argue there is an urgent need to validate and enhance the utility of big unstructured data by: 1) maintaining existing well-designed, standardised long-term species population studies; 2) strengthening data quality control, management, and curation of any type of dataset; and 3) developing purpose-specific rankings to assess data quality.},

  abstract = {Stand-level retention is an important component of sustainable forest management which aims to balance ecological, social and economic objectives. Long-term retention of mature forest structures at the time of harvesting (variable retention) is intended to produce future forest stands that more closely resemble conditions that develop after natural disturbances, thereby maintaining greater diversity of habitats for a variety of organisms. Structure includes features such as live and dead trees representing multiple canopy layers, undisturbed understory vegetation and coarse woody debris. Over the past two decades, variable retention has become common on forest lands in the temperate rainforests of coastal British Columbia (BC) and has been applied to a lesser extent in inland forest types. Our review of studies in BC and in similar forest types in our region indicates that both aggregated and dispersed retention can contribute to biodiversity conservation by providing short-term life-boating' habitat for some species and by enhancing the structural characteristics of future stands. For example, greater abundance of species present in the pre-harvest forest have been documented for vegetation, birds, carabid beetles, gastropods, ectomycorrhizal fungi and soil fauna in retention cutblocks compared to clearcuts. There are, however, some negative consequences for timber production such as wind damage to retained trees and reduced growth rates of tree regeneration compared to clearcuts. The authors suggest an adaptive management approach for balancing competing objectives when faced with uncertainty. This includes monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of various strategies for achieving goals. Over two decades of experience applying variable retention harvesting to industrial-scale management of forest lands in BC suggests that it is possible to balance production of wood with biodiversity conservation.},

Increment cores were taken from mature eastern white pines (Pinus strobus L.) in 144 sample points in 12 partially harvested and 6 unharvested control stands in Ontario, Canada, to determine how these trees responded to a `structural retention harvest' that had occurred 9 years previously. Prior to harvest, increment growth was slightly lower in control stands, but not significantly so. Strong correlation in diameter increments among stands indicates external climatic forcing or internal synchronicity, e.g. reproductive allocation. Three years after harvest, growth in harvested stands overtook that in control stands, and increased to 63+/-8\% SE above expected levels by 8 years after harvest. The study demonstrates the ability of old trees to respond markedly to reduced competition, questioning the concept of an age-related decline in forest productivity. In addition to increased timber production, growth responses of old trees have important implications for stand regeneration, wind firmness, and maintenance of wildlife habitat elements following partial stand harvests. Comparison of disturbed stands with undisturbed stands allows better estimation of tree responses than methods in which disturbance is inferred from diameter increment variation within individual trees.},

In contrast to then-current guidelines. declining- and cavity-trees. snags and coarse woody debris (cwd) were retained at harvest. Cut and uncut stands were surveyed in 2001 to determine the effects of this harvest on forest structure. Basal area prism sweeps for trees and snags were taken at 100 m spacing in 12 logged and six unlogged stands in August 2001. Ground cover, regeneration, and cwd were recorded. White pine basal area before harvest varied among stands from 4.5 to 25.7 m(2) ha(-1), or 21-68\% of stand total. No white pine trees below 18 cm dbh were found. Around half of while pine basal area was removed at harvest. Logging damage was found on 7\% of residual white pines. Harvested stands had similar numbers of cavity trees, standing snags, and volume of natural-origin cwd, to unharvested stands. Inputs of logged white pines left in situ increased the total volume of cwd in harvested stands compared with unharvested stands. Harvested stands also contained more recently dead pines and tip-over trees than unharvested stands. White pine regeneration was scarce, though marginally greater in cut stands. Regeneration was correlated with increased canopy openness in cut stands. Herbaceous cover and sapling density, was greater in harvested stands. The study shows that structural retention harvesting can maintain or exceed levels of habitat provision such as cavity trees and cwd, found in old stands, though increased tree mortality and wind-throw can result (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Relative abundance of Canada Warblers decreased over time on our West Virginia study area (Wildlife and Ecosystem Research Forest) and within the Appalachian Bird Conservation Region. Initially, relative abundance was greater closer to roads, but as timber harvests became more common, relative abundance became positively associated with amount of light partial harvests at the local scale. Nest survival was 45.6 {$\pm$} 18.3\% during 1996-1998 and 24.9 {$\pm$} 14.6\% during 2007-2009, but did not differ (P=0.38) between these periods. Areas around nests in 2007-2009 (n=17) had less intermediate canopy cover and fewer residual trees but more green cover, woody debris, and pole trees than areas around nests in 1996-1998 (n=10). Successful nests had more low cover, less vertical diversity, more woody debris, more saplings, and greater edge density than failed nests. We found a positive association between relative abundance and all three types of timber harvests and an improvement in habitat through understory development and retention of residual trees.

However, greater understanding of the drivers of habitat loss and of the circumstances under which protected areas succeed or fail is still needed. We use visual assessment of satellite images to quantify land-cover change over periods of up to 30 years in and around a matched sample of protected and unprotected Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) in Africa. We modelled the annual survival of forests and other natural land covers as a function of a range of environmental and anthropic predictors of plausible drivers. The best-supported model indicated that survival rates of natural land cover were highest in steeper areas, at higher altitudes, in areas with lower human population densities and in areas where the cover of natural habitats was already higher at the start of the period. Survival rates of natural land cover in protected areas were, on average, around twice those in unprotected areas, but the differences between them varied along different environmental gradients. The overall survival rates of both protected and unprotected forests were significantly lower than those of other natural land-cover types, but the net benefit of protection, in terms of the absolute difference in rates of loss between protected and unprotected sites, was higher in forests. Interaction terms indicated that as slope and altitude increased, the natural protection offered by topography increasingly nullified the additional benefits of legislative protection. Furthermore, protected area designation offered reduced additional benefits to the survival of natural land cover in areas where rates of conversion were higher at the start of the observation period. Variation in the impacts of protected area status along different environmental gradients indicates that targets to improve the world's protected area network, such as Aichi Target 11 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, need to look beyond simple area-based metrics.

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to evaluate the contributions of forest and landscape structure derived from remote sensing instruments to habitat mapping. Our empirical data focused at the landscape scale on a test site in northern Michigan, using radar and Landsat imagery and bird-presence data by species. We tested the contributions of multi-dimensional forest and landscape structure variables using GARP (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production), a representative modeling methodology used in biodiversity informatics. For our multi-dimensional variables, radar data were processed to derive forest biomass maps and these data were used with a Landsat-derived vegetation type classification and spatial neighborhood analyses. We collected field data on bird species presence and habitat for northern forest birds known to have a range of vegetation habitat requirements. We modeled and tested the relationships between bird presence and 1) vegetation type, 2) vegetation type and spatial neighborhood descriptions, 3) vegetation type and biomass, and 4) all variables together, using GARP, for three bird species. Modeled results showed that inclusion of biomass or neighborhoods improved the accuracy of bird habitat prediction over vegetation type alone, and that the inclusion of neighborhoods and biomass together generally produced the greatest improvement. The maps and model rules resulting from the multiple factor models were interpreted to be more precise depictions of a particular species habitat when compared with the models that used vegetation type only. We suggest that for bird species whose niche requirements include forest and landscape structure, inclusion of multi-dimensional information may be advantageous in habitat modeling at the landscape level. Further research should focus on testing additional variables and species, on further integration of newer radar and lidar remote sensing capabilities with multi-spectral sensors for quantifying forest and landscape multi-dimensional structure, and incorporating these in biodiversity informatics modeling. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Biodiversity and habitat face increasing pressures due to human and natural influences that alter vegetation structure. Because of the inherent difficulty of measuring forested vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure on the ground, this important component of biodiversity and habitat has been, until recently, largely restricted to local measurements, or at larger scales to generalizations. New lidar and radar remote sensing instruments such as those proposed for spaceborne missions will provide the capability to fill this gap. This paper reviews the state of the art for incorporatinginformation on vegetation 3-D structure into biodiversity and habitat science and management approaches, with emphasis on use of lidar and radar data. First we review relationships between vegetation 3-D structure, biodiversity and habitat, and metrics commonly used to describe those relationships. Next, we review the technical capabilities of new lidar and radar sensors and their application to biodiversity and habitat studies to date. We then define variables that have been identified as both useful and feasible to retrieve from spaceborne lidar and radar observations and provide their accuracy and precision requirements. We conclude with a brief discussion of implications for spaceborne missions and research programs. The possibility to derive vegetation 3-D measurements from spaceborne active sensors and to integrate them into science and management comes at a critical juncture for global biodiversity conservation and opens new possibilities for advanced scientific analysis of habitat and biodiversity.},

Research undertaken over the last 30 years has given us a very different perspective of the complexity of Canadian boreal forests. Old-growth forests are common and their development is controlled by nonfire disturbances. Consequently, monospecific even-aged stands can develop towards more diversified uneven-aged stands with increasing time since fire. This complex disturbance regime, including both fire and nonfire disturbances, is partially responsible for a higher than expected biodiversity (e.g., understory) in these forests. The dominating forest management model in Canadian boreal forests, based on clear-cut harvesting and regeneration of short rotation even-aged stands, does not reflect the complexities of the disturbance-succession cycle observed in Canadian natural boreal forests.},

  abstract = {The southern portions of the boreal region across Canada are dominated by boreal mixedwoods forests, which are characterized by varying canopy dominance of boreal broadleaf and conifer trees. This forest region encompasses a large east-to-west gradient of climate and disturbance regimes. Although the same major boreal tree species occur in all parts of the boreal mixedwood region, they vary greatly in relative abundance. This is a reflection of the interactions among the different abiotic and biotic components. As a result, there is considerable variation in post-disturbance stand development, producing a wide variety of mixedwood forest conditions existing as a mosaic in time and space. Post-disturbance dominance by broadleaf species followed by a transition to conifers is the "classic" pathway in all regions. However, there is wide variation in the transition rate and the species sequence across the gradient depending on factors such as moisture, abundance of each species, fire cycle, climate and secondary disturbances (mainly insect outbreaks). Future changes in climate and disturbance regime could influence the nature of stand dynamics of boreal mixedwoods and the prominence of different pathways among regions. Focussing on the commonality of processes in mixedwood stand development across the boreal is a promising way to address the management of this important forest ecosystem.

  abstract = {The extent to which past states influence present and future ecosystem characteristics (ecosystem memory (EM)) is challenging to assess because signals of past ecological conditions fade with time. Using data about seven different taxa, we show that ecological gradients initiated by wildfires up to three centuries earlier affect biotic recovery after variable retention harvest in the boreal mixedwood forest. First, we show that fire history over the last 300 years is reflected in pre-harvest species-specific stand basal area (BA), with longer times since high severity fire associated with proportionally higher BA of shade-tolerant softwood species than shade-intolerant hardwoods. Second, using patterns in the BA of pre-harvest tree species we link fire history to species composition of pre-harvest assemblages of bryophytes, herbs, shrubs, regenerated trees, songbirds, spiders and carabid beetles. Finally, we use variance partitioning to compare the importance of species-specific pre- versus post-harvest BA for explaining the structure of these seven biotic assemblages two, five and ten years after harvest. We detected persistent significant effects of pre-harvest BA in all post-harvest biotic assemblages up to ten years after harvest. Pre-harvest BA was more strongly associated with early post-harvest understory plant and carabid beetle assemblages than was post-harvest BA, but the opposite was true for spiders, songbirds and regenerated trees. EM effects were detected two, five and ten years after harvest but temporal patterns varied according to taxa. Thus, EM of fire history can persist at least ten years after variable retention harvest and such effects appear to be stronger for understory plants than for animals. We conclude that management of biological legacies to increase post-disturbance EM will increase overall resilience and sustainability of these mixedwood forests.},

With the exception of the large-scale use of careful logging to protect advanced regeneration in ecosystems generally controlled by fire, stand-level silvicultural practices currently used are reasonably similar to natural disturbances, although important differences exist. In contrast, at the forest-level, even-aged management, as is currently practised, rarely permits adequate reproduction of the variety of age classes, stand types, and structural components normally found in the boreal forest. A model that allows an even-aged management approach by natural dynamics is proposed.},

  abstract = {The degree to which spatial patterns influence the dynamics and distribution of populations is a central question in ecology. This question is even more pressing in the context of rapid habitat loss and fragmentation, which threaten global biodiversity. However, the relative influence of habitat loss and landscape fragmentation, the spatial patterning of remaining habitat, remains unclear. If landscape pattern affects population size, managers may be able to design landscapes that mitigate habitat loss. We present the results of a mensurative experiment designed to test four habitat loss vs. fragmentation hypotheses. Unlike previous studies, we measured landscape structure using quantitative, spatially explicit habitat distribution models previously developed for two species: Blackburnian Warbler (Dendroica fusca) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla). We used a stratified sampling design that reduced the confounding of habitat amount and fragmentation variables. Occurrence and reoccurrence of both species were strongly influenced by characteristics at scales greater than the individual territory, indicating little support for the random-sample hypothesis. However, the type and spatial extent of landscape influence differed. Both occurrence and reoccurrence of Blackburnian Warblers were influenced by the amount of poor-quality matrix at 300-and 2000-m spatial extents. The occurrence and reoccurrence of Ovenbirds depended on a landscape pattern variable, patch size, but only in cases when patches were isolated. These results support the hypothesis that landscape pattern is important for some species only when the amount of suitable habitat is low. Although theoretical models have predicted such an interaction between landscape fragmentation and composition, to our knowledge this is the first study to report empirical evidence of such nonlinear fragmentation effects. Defining landscapes quantitatively from an organism-based perspective may increase power to detect fragmentation effects, particularly in forest mosaics where boundaries between patches and matrix are ambiguous. Our results indicate that manipulating landscape pattern may reduce negative impacts of habitat loss for Ovenbird, but not Blackburnian Warbler. We emphasize that most variance in the occurrence of both species was explained by local scale or landscape composition variables rather than variables reflecting landscape pattern.},

Using a database containing 73 datasets collected worldwide (encompassing 4489 animal species), we found that the proportion of fragmentation-sensitive species was nearly three times as high in regions with low rates of historical disturbance compared with regions with high rates of disturbance (i.e., fires, glaciation, hurricanes, and deforestation). These disturbances coincide with a latitudinal gradient in which sensitivity increases sixfold at low versus high latitudes. We conclude that conservation efforts to limit edges created by fragmentation will be most important in the world's tropical forests.},

Here, we show that over the last 30 yr biomass, basal area, growth, and recruitment have decreased along with a precipitous rise in mortality across the dominant tree species. The stand experienced periods of drought in combination with multiple outbreaks of forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria) and bark beetles. These insect disturbances interacted to increase mortality rates within the stand and decrease stand density.

Many studies have examined the separate impacts on fauna and flora of wildfire, conventional logging, and salvage logging, but empirical comparisons across a broad gradient of simultaneous disturbances are lacking. We quantified species richness and frequency of occurrence of vascular plants, and functional group responses, across a gradient of disturbances that occurred concurrently in 2009 in the mountain ash forests of southeastern Australia. Our study encompassed replicated sites in undisturbed forest (similar to 70 yr post fire), forest burned at low severity, forest burned at high severity, unburned forest that was clearcut logged, and forest burned at high severity that was clearcut salvage logged post-fire. All sites were sampled 2 and 3 yr post fire. Mean species richness decreased across the disturbance gradient from 30.1 species/site on low-severity burned sites and 28.9 species/site on high-severity burned sites, to 25.1 species/site on clearcut sites and 21.7 species/site on salvage logged sites. Low-severity burned sites were significantly more species-rich than clearcut sites and salvage logged sites; high-severity burned sites supported greater species richness than salvage logged sites. Specific traits influenced species' sensitivity to disturbance. Resprouting species dominated undisturbed mountain ash forests, but declined significantly across the gradient. Fern and midstory trees decreased significantly in frequency of occurrence across the gradient. Ferns (excluding bracken) decreased from 34\% of plants in undisturbed forest to 3\% on salvage logged sites. High-severity burned sites supported a greater frequency of occurrence and species richness of midstory trees compared to clearcut and salvage logged sites. Salvage logging supported fewer midstory trees than any other disturbance category, and were distinctly different from clearcut sites. Plant life form groups, including midstory trees, shrubs, and ferns, were dominated by very few species on logged sites. The differences in biotic response across the gradient of natural and human disturbances have significant management implications, particularly the need to reduce mechanical disturbance overall and to leave specific areas with no mechanical disturbance across the cut area during logging operations, to ensure the persistence of resprouting taxa.},

  abstract = {Although most researchers use the terms "guild" and "functional group" more or less synonymously, these two concepts bear different meanings. The guild concept refers primarily to the mechanisms of resource sharing by species in a competitive context whereas the functional groups concept is concerned with how a resource or any other ecological component is processed by different species to provide a specific ecosystem service or function. In many cases but not necessarily all, the two concepts are the two "facesquot; or "sides" of the same coin: the sharing by species of a similar resource is the guild facet (structural), while the ecosystem processes these species eventually perform through resource exploitation is the functional group facet. The two concepts differ in that competitive relationships within groups of species are not the focus of the functional group approach, exactly as processes or functions are not the focus of the guild approach. A group of species can be considered either as a guild or a functional group depending on the question addressed. Guild and functional group membership is independent of phylogenetic relationships but because species tend to share similar life history traits and adaptations through common evolutionary history, guild and functional group associates are often closely related. The concept of guild has had broader application in animal studies than in plant studies, whereas the reverse is true for the concept of functional group. Recent methodological advances to objectively partition species into guilds and functional groups, taking into consideration the most relevant characters or traits for delineating them, provide the means to construct an operational framework for making in situ and ex situ experiments that are urgently needed for a better understanding of the role of species in ecosystem functioning, especially in relation to global change concerns.},

Remote sensing tools are capable of assessing dynamics in wildlife-habitat associations over a wide range of spatial scales and in a variety of ecosystems. As already well-established in other ecosystems, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDaR) technology has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of tundra wildlife-habitat associations because unlike the most commonly used spectral vegetation index - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) - LiDaR directly quantifies three-dimensional (3-D) vegetation structure. Only recently has airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology evolved to having vertical resolution and point densities high enough to quantify small differences in vegetation structure, such as characterize arctic tundra ecosystems. Our objective was to employ ALS metrics, airborne spectral data (for NDVI), and Landsat 7 ETM+ data (for snow cover) to determine the relative importance of a suite of ecological characteristics - considered at multiple spatial scales - on habitat use and reproductive success of two of the most common migratory songbird species breeding in northern Alaska. Our most important findings are that (1) combining ALS metrics, but not NDVI, with Landsat derived snow cover data provided useful information, revealing that while Gambel's white-crowned sparrows use breeding territories in areas with high canopy volume and large snow-free areas, Lapland longspurs will establish territories in areas with low canopy volume, small patches of snow-free tundra, and minimal surface wetness and; (2) while habitat characteristics were important determinants of habitat use for both species at the territory scale, those in the immediate vicinity of nest-sites were not important. Contrary to expectation, we also found that the reproductive success of both species was unaffected by variation in our hypothesized metrics of shelter and food availability (canopy volume, standard deviation of micro-terrain height) at both the nest-site or territory scales. Our study is the first arctic demonstration of how ALS yields novel insights into wildlife-habitat associations, suggesting it has great potential in other ecosystems with similarly small - yet often ecologically important - ranges in 3-D vegetation structure.},

We stratified burned areas into patches of dense ({$>$}. 50\% canopy cover) and open (20-50\% canopy cover) forests based on a classification of pre-fire Landsat imagery, and used these patches to establish a 25-year chronosequence of structural development for each class. While structural attributes were similar between dense and open patches during the first ten years since fire (YSF), canopy cover (cover above 2. m) and stand height (75th height percentile) were significantly higher (p. {$<$}. 0.001) for dense patches by the end of the chronosequence (20-25. YSF), suggesting that differences in site productivity were driving patches towards pre-disturbance structure.

Additionally, we assessed the structural complexity of burned stands using measures of canopy roughness (i.e., rumple) and the distribution shape of lidar returns (i.e., skewness and kurtosis), which provided evidence of young, even-aged structure once a new overstory was formed. As forest inventories are not routinely conducted across Canada's northern boreal, the fusion of Landsat time-series and airborne lidar data provides powerful means for assessing changes in forest structure following disturbance over this large forested area.},

  abstract = {Continuous-based predictors of habitat characteristics derived from satellite imagery are increasingly used in species distribution models (SDM). This is especially the case of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which provides estimates of vegetation productivity and heterogeneity. However, when NDVI predictors are incorporated into SDM, synchrony between biological observations and image acquisition must be questionned. Due to seasonal variations of NDVI during the year, landscape patterns of habitats are revealed differently from one date to another leading to variations in models' performance. In this paper, we investigated the influence of acquisition time period of NDVI to explain and predict bird community patterns over France. We examined if the NDVI acquisition period that best fit the bird data depends on the dominant land cover context. We also compared models based on single time period of NDVI with one model built from the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI) components which summarize variations in vegetation phenology throughout the year from the fraction of radiation absorbed by the canopy (fPAR). Bird species richness was calculated as response variable for 759 plots of 4 km(2) from the French Breeding Bird Survey. Bird specialists and generalists to habitat were considered. NDVI and DHI predictors were both derived from MODIS products. For NDVI, five time periods in 2010 were compared, from late winter to begin of autumn. A climate predictor was also used and Generalized Additive Models were fitted to explain and predict bird species richness. Results showed that NDVI-based proxies of dominant habitat identity and spatial heterogeneity explain more bird community patterns than DHI-based proxies of annual productivity and seasonnality. We also found that models' performance was both time and context-dependent, varying according to the bird groups. In general, best time period of NDVI did not match with the acquisition period of bird data because in case of synchrony, differences in habitats are less pronounced. These findings suggest that the most powerful approach to estimate bird community patterns is the simplest one. It only requires NDVI predictors from a single appropriate time period, in addition to climate, which makes the approach very operational.},

As a result, alternative silvicultural practices including variants of partial cutting are increasingly being applied in the boreal forest as an approach to balancing economic and ecological management objectives. While the numerous benefits of partial cutting reported in the literature are acknowledged, the objective of this paper is to provide an overview of factors or constraints that potentially limit the application of these practices in boreal Canada in the context of forest ecosystem management and natural disturbance-based silviculture. Among constraining factors, numerous studies have reported elevated mortality rates of residual stems following partial cutting, initial growth stagnation of residual trees, problems related to recruitment of desirable species and, on certain flat or lowland sites, risks of long-term decline in site and stand productivity. A number of operational challenges to partial cutting in the boreal forest are also presented and several avenues of research are proposed.},

  abstract = {In the current context of forest ecosystem management, partial harvesting has been proposed as a silvi-cultural tool to augment forest variability on managed landscapes and to accelerate the development of structural and compositional attributes of old-growth/late successional stands. The aims of this paper were to (1) identify and characterize, based on the literature, the structural attributes of old-growth aspen-dominated stands in the North American boreal mixedwood forest, and (2) examine the short-term potential of partial harvesting in aspen-dominated stands to accelerate stand development toward these old-growth characteristics. Two stand types pure aspen (93\% aspen basal area) and mixed aspen (81\% aspen basal area) were monitored over a 12-year post-treatment period. The scientific literature suggests that compared to pure, even-aged premature or mature stands, old-growth aspen stands have lower merchantable stem densities and basal area, more large aspen stems, higher stem size variability, more than one cohort of trees, greater percentage area occupied by gaps, higher expanded gap area, and more and larger snags and downed wood. In addition, old-growth aspen mixedwoods characteristically have more shade-tolerant conifers in understory and overstory layers than younger, mature stands. Results of this study indicate that light thinning from below (33\% basal area removal) applied in pure aspen stands successfully retained most of the structural attributes of mature aspen stands, but did not generally ``accelerate succession\{''\} toward old-growth traits in the 12-year time interval since treatment. A dispersed free thinning (45\% basal area removal in all merchantable size classes) applied in mixed aspen stands showed its potential to ``accelerate succession\{''\} by creating canopy gaps similar to old-growth aspen stands and by promoting recruitment of both tolerant and intolerant tree species. Two high intensity partial harvesting treatments, a thinning from above of 61\% basal area in pure aspen stands and 400 m(2) gap cuts (54\% basal area removal) in mixed aspen stands may set back stand development by disproportionally favoring recruitment and growth of intolerant hardwood species.

Objectives This study aims to document spatiotem-poral patterns of logging and fire since the introduction of logging in the early twentieth-century, and to evaluate the effects of these disturbances on landscape structure. Methods We used historical (1940\textendash 2009) logging and fire maps to document disturbance patterns across a 195,000-km 2 boreal forest landscape of eastern Canada. We produced multitemporal (1970s\textendash 2010s) mosaics providing land cover status using Landsat imagery. Results Logging significantly increased the rate of disturbance (?74 \%) in the study area. The area affected by logging increased linearly with time resulting in a significant rejuvenation of the landscape along the harvesting pattern (south\textendash north progres-sion). From 1940 to 2009, fire was the dominant disturbance and showed a more random spatial distribution than logging. The recent increase of fire influence and the expansion of the proportion of area classified as unproductive terrestrial land suggest that regeneration failures occurred. Conclusions This study reveals how logging has modified the disturbances dynamics, following the progression of the logging frontier. Future manage-ment practices should aim for a dispersed spatial distribution of harvests to generate landscape struc-tures that are closer to natural conditions, in line with ecosystem-based management. The challenges of defining sustainable practices will remain complex with the predicted increase in fire frequency, since this factor, in combination with logging, can alter both the structure and potentially the resilience of boreal forest.},

Such ecosystems may be monitored by examining the diet of upper trophic level species, which varies with prey availability. To assess interannual variation in the Beaufort Sea ecosystem, we examined spatial and temporal trends in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N in claw growth layers grown from 1964 to 2011. Stable isotopes were correlated with climate indices, environmental conditions, seal population productivity, and geographic location. Sex and age did not influence stable isotopes. Enriched 13C was linked to cyclonic circulation regimes, seal productivity, and westward sampling locations. Higher {$\delta$}15N was linked to lower sea surface temperatures, a higher percentage of pups in the subsistence harvest, and sample locations that were eastward and further from shore. From the 1960s to 2000s, ringed seal niche width expanded, suggesting a diversification of diet due to expansion of prey and/or seal space use. Overall, trends in ringed seal stable isotopes indicate changes within the Beaufort Sea ecosystem affected by water temperatures and circulation regimes. We suggest that continued monitoring of upper trophic level species will yield insights into changing ecosystem structure with climate change.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t This study proposed modifying the conceptual approach that is commonly used to model development of stand attribute estimates using airborne LiDAR data. New models were developed using an area-based approach to pre-dict wood volume, stem volume, aboveground biomass, and basal-area across a wide range of canopy structures, sites and LiDAR characteristics. This new modeling approach does not adopt standard approaches of stepwise re-gression using a series of height metrics derived from airborne LiDAR. Rather, it used four metrics describing complementary 3D structural aspects of the stand canopy. The first three metrics were related to mean canopy height, height heterogeneity, and horizontal canopy distribution. A fourth metric was calculated as the coefficient of variation of the leaf area density profile. This fourth metric provided information on understory vegetation. The models that were developed with the four structural metrics provided higher estimation accuracy on stand attri-butes than models using height metrics alone, while also avoiding data over-fitting. Overall, the models provided prediction error levels ranging from 12.4\% to 24.2\%, depending upon forest type and stand attribute. The more homogeneous coniferous stand provided the highest estimation accuracy. Estimation errors were significantly reduced in mixed forest when separate models were developed for individual stand types (coniferous, mixed and deciduous stands) instead of a general model for all stand types. Model robustness was also evaluated in leaf-off and leaf-on conditions where both conditions provided similar estimation errors.},

  abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/ unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/ available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k -fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms. \#},

Animals generally are more abundant in habitats that are selected most strongly. Models of habitat selection can be used to distribute animals on the landscape or their distribution can be modelled based on data of habitat use, occupancy, intensity of use or counts of animals. When the population is at carrying capacity or in an ideal-free distribution, habitat selection and related metrics of habitat use can be used to estimate abundance. If the population is not at equilibrium, models have the flexibility to incorporate density into models of habitat selection; but abundance might be influenced by factors influencing fitness that are not directly related to habitat thereby compromising the use of habitat-based models for predicting population size. Scale and domain of the sampling frame, both in time and space, are crucial considerations limiting application of these models. Ultimately, identifying reliable models for predicting abundance from habitat data requires an understanding of the mechanisms underlying population regulation and limitation.},

Ongoing work at the Capitol State Forest, located near Olympia, Washington, has provided a comprehensive look at visual preferences for six alternative harvest patterns by various interest groups. These groups include foresters, recreationists, environmentalists, educators, and the general public. Groups tend to share a common preference for patterns showing minimal disturbance but are significantly different as the intensity of harvest practices increase. Foresters showed higher preferences for intensive forest management practices, whereas all other groups indicated a lower preference for intensive forest practices. Tree retention, harvest size, and residual material seem to be contributing factors related to preference ratings.}

It regulates climate, acts as a reservoir for biological and genetic diversity, plays a key role in biogeochemical cycles, and provides renewable resources, habitat, and recreational opportunities. Poor agreement exists amongst scientists regarding this zone's delimitation and the areal extent of boreal forests, even though the zone has been well-studied. This paper reviews the literature on the phytogeography of the zone and makes use of a geographic information system (GIS) and published maps to delineate a current map of the North American boreal zone and the hemiboreal subzone, which is a transitional area lying immediately to the south of the boreal zone that is usually included in the boreal zone by Europeans but excluded by North Americans. On the basis of the map described here, the boreal zone covers about 627 million ha, or 29\% of the North American continent north of Mexico. If the hemiboreal subzone, at 116 million ha, is included, then 34\% of the same area is covered. Forests and other wooded land (362 million ha) cover 58\% of the North American boreal zone on the basis of current forest inventory data. With forests and other wooded land of the hemiboreal subzone (68 million ha) factored in, this percentage remains basically unchanged. Values reported in this paper are compared with other published statistics. Important sources of error contributing to differences in areal statistics are discussed.},

Because of its resources and its hydroelectric potential, Canada's boreal zone is important to the country's resource-based economy. The region presently occupied by Canada's boreal zone has experienced dramatic changes during the past 3 million years as the climate cooled and repeated glaciations affected both the biota and the landscape. For about the past 7000 years, climate, fire, insects, diseases, and their interactions have been the most important natural drivers of boreal ecosystem dynamics, including rejuvenation, biogeochemical cycling, maintenance of productivity, and landscape variability. Layered upon natural drivers are changes increasingly caused by people and development and those related to human-caused climate change. Effects of these agents vary spatially and temporally, and, as global population increases, the demands and impacts on ecosystems will likely increase. Understanding how humans directly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Canada's boreal zone and how these effects and actions interact with natural disturbance agents is a prerequisite for informed and adaptive decisions about management of natural resources, while maintaining the economy and environment upon which humans depend. This paper reports on the genesis and present condition of the boreal zone and its ecosystems and sets the context for a detailed scientific investigation in subsequent papers published in this journal on several key aspects: carbon in boreal forests; climate change consequences, adaptation, and mitigation; nutrient and elemental cycling; protected areas; status, impacts, and risks of non-native species; factors affecting sustainable timber harvest levels; terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity; and water and wetland resources. \textcopyright{} 2013 Published by NRC Research Press.},

  abstract = {Stand structure, the arrangement and interrelationships of live and dead trees, has been linked to forest regeneration, nutrient cycling, wildlife habitat, and climate regulation. The objective of this review was to synthesize literature on stand structural dynamics of North American boreal forests, addressing both live tree and coarse woody debris (CWD) characteristics under different disturbance mechanisms (fire, clearcut, wind, and spruce budworm), while identifying regional differences based on climate and surficial deposit variability. In fire origin stands, both live tree and CWD attributes are influenced initially largely by the characteristics of the stand replacing fire and later increasingly by autogenic processes. Differences in stand structure have also been observed between various stand cover types. Blowdown and insect outbreaks are two significant non-stand replacing disturbances that can alter forest stand structure through removing canopy trees, freeing up available growing space, and creating microsites for new trees to establish. Climate and surficial deposits are highly variable in the boreal forest due to its extensive geographic range, influencing stand and landscape structure by affecting tree colonization, stand composition, successional trajectories, CWD dynamics, and disturbance regimes including regional fire cycles. Further, predicted climate change scenarios are likely to cause regional-specific alterations in stand and landscape structure, with the implications on ecosystem components including wildlife, biodiversity, and carbon balance still unclear. Some stand structural attributes are found to be similar between clearcut and fire origin stands, but others appear to be quite different. Future research shall focus on examining structural variability under both disturbance regimes and management alternatives emulating both stand replacing and non-stand replacing natural disturbances.

  abstract = {Changes in the structure of woodlands and forests, caused by shifts in management, stand maturity, and composition, have been implicated in the population decline of some bird species in Europe and North America. One such species is the Marsh Tit (Poecile palustris). We investigated relationships between Marsh Tit occupation (derived from territory mapping) and vegetation structure, tree species composition, and proximity to woodland edge in a British woodland, using a combination of 5 years of occupation data and high-resolution (0.5 and 1 m), large-scale (155 ha) habitat models derived from remote sensing. The results demonstrated that Marsh Tit occupation was linked to vegetation characteristics through the woodland's full vertical profile and related significantly and positively with overstory height, tree canopy closure, and the coverage of understory vegetation below the overstory. Marsh Tit occupation was lower within 50 m of the woodland perimeter, where habitat structure was less favorable than in the woodland interior. No preference was shown for areas rich in any particular prevalent tree species. Our results suggest that widespread changes in woodland structure resulting from abandonment by managers are unlikely to be responsible for the decline of the Marsh Tit in Britain and that reintroduction of active management that prevents woodland maturation could be detrimental to remaining populations. The study demonstrates a novel approach to integrating territory maps and remote-sensing data to permit highly detailed analyses of bird-habitat interactions and may have wider implications for woodland management and related bird species.},

Availability of airborne digital remote sensing (LiDAR) data for Monks Wood allowed the characterization of the canopy structure in territories and non-breeding areas using a three-dimensional canopy-height model. The difference between the mean canopy height of the 2004 territories and that of the unoccupied area of the study site in the same year was 1.8 m, or 14\%. Sampling the unoccupied area, with hypothetical `pseudo-territories', showed a statistically significant difference of 1.6 m (13\%) between the mean canopy heights of the `taller' 2004 territories and the unoccupied pseudo-territories. A comparison by field survey of tree and shrub species composition between the 2004 territories and pseudo-territories found no difference in species richness or the mean density of shrubs or mature trees ({$>$} 30 cm diameter at breast height, dbh). The mean density of medium-sized (5-30 cm dbh) and small ({$<$} 5 cm dbh) trees was, respectively, 1.9 and 3.9 times greater in the pseudo-territories, values that were statistically significant. Overall, Marsh Tits in Monks Wood appeared to require mature trees with a shrub layer beneath the top canopy, but avoided areas with large numbers of young and immature trees.},

Aims To investigate winter habitat selection by Marsh Tits in a British wood, testing for preferences in tree species and woodland structure. Methods Thirteen Marsh Tits were radio-tracked during the winter, and home-ranges were derived. Lidar and hyperspectral data were used to compare the vegetation structure and tree species composition of entire home-ranges and the core areas of intensive use within. Instantaneous sampling observations provided further information for tree species utilization. Results The mean home-range was very large (39 ha, n = 13). There were no significant differences in mean tree height, canopy closure, understorey height, or shrub volume between full home-ranges and the core areas of use. Core areas contained a significantly greater proportion of English Oak relative to availability in the full home-ranges. Instantaneous sampling confirmed that English Oak was used significantly more than other trees. Conclusion Selection for English Oak during winter contrasted with previous studies of breeding territories, indicating that habitat usage varies seasonally and demonstrating the need for habitat selection studies throughout the year. Large home-ranges help to explain the Marsh Tit's sensitivity to habitat fragmentation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Detecting disturbances in native vegetation is a crucial component of many environmental management strategies, and remote sensing-based methods are the most efficient way to collect multi-temporal disturbance data over large areas. Given that there is a large range of datasets for monitoring, analyzing, and detecting disturbances, many methods have been well-studied and successfully implemented. However, factors such as the vegetation type, input data, and change detection method can significantly alter the outcomes of a disturbance-detection study. We evaluated the spatial agreement of disturbance maps provided by the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm, evaluating seven spectral indices in three distinct vegetation domains in Brazil: Atlantic forest, savanna, and semi-arid woodland, by assessing levels of agreement between the outputs. We computed individual map accuracies based on a reference dataset, then ranked their performance, while also observing their relationships with specific vegetation domains. Our results indicated a low rate of spatial agreement among index-based disturbance maps, which itself was minimally influenced by vegetation domain. Wetness indices produced greater detection accuracies in comparison to greenness-related indices free of saturation. The normalized difference moisture index performed best in the Atlantic forest domains, yet performed poorest in semi-arid woodland, reflecting its specific sensitivity to vegetation and its water content. The normalized difference vegetation index led to high disturbance detection accuracies in the savanna and semi-arid woodland domains. This study offered novel insight into vegetation disturbance maps, their relationship to different ecosystem types, and corresponding accuracies. Distinct input data can produce non-spatially correlated disturbance maps and reflect site-specific sensitivity. Future research should explore algorithm limitations presented in this study, as well as the expansion to other techniques and vegetation domains across the globe.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The magnitude of this bias depended on the parameter values used for simulation. For the case study, a spatial-temporal model was more parsimonious and had higher predictive performance relative to simpler models, and did not support the slow-growing walleye hypothesis in Alberta.

Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can measure the canopy structure in 3D with high detail. In this study, we develop an approach to estimate AGB from TLS data, which does not need any prior information about allometry. We compare these estimates against destructively harvested AGB estimates and AGB derived from allometric equations. We also evaluate tree parameters, diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height, estimated from traditional field inventory and TLS data. Tree height, DBH and AGB data are collected through traditional forest inventory, TLS and destructive sampling of 65 trees in a native Eucalypt Open Forest in Victoria, Australia. Single trees are extracted from the TLS data and quantitative structure models are used to estimate the tree volume directly from the point cloud data. AGB is inferred from these volumes and basic density information and is then compared with the estimates derived from allometric equations and destructive sampling. AGB estimates derived from TLS show a high agreement with the reference values from destructive sampling, with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 098. The agreement between AGB estimates from allometric equations and the reference is lower (CCC= 068-078). Our TLS approach shows a total AGB overestimation of 968\% compared to an underestimation of 3657-2985\% for the allometric equations. The error for AGB estimates using allometric equations increases exponentially with increasing DBH, whereas the error for AGB estimates from TLS is not dependent on DBH. The TLS method does not rely on indirect relationships with tree parameters or calibration data and shows better agreement with the reference data compared to estimates from allometric equations. Using 3D data also enables us to look at the height distributions of AGB, and we demonstrate that 80\% of the AGB at plot level is located in the lower 60\% of the trees for a Eucalypt Open Forest. This method can be applied in many forest types and can assist in the calibration and validation of broad-scale biomass maps.},

  abstract = {An accurate estimation of total biomass and its components is critical for understanding the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems. The objectives of this study were  to explore the performances of forest canopy structure characterization from a single  small-footprint Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset using two different techniques focusing on (i) 3-D canopy structural information by discrete (XYZ) LiDAR metrics  (DR-metrics), and (ii) the detailed geometric and radiometric information of the returned waveform by full-waveform LiDAR metrics (FW-metrics), and to evaluate the capacity of these metrics in predicting biomass and its components in subtropical forest ecosystems. This study was undertaken in a mixed subtropical forest in Yushan Mountain National Park, Jiangsu, China. LiDAR metrics derived from DR and FW LiDAR data were used alone, and in combination, in stepwise regression models to estimate total as well as above-ground, root, foliage, branch and trunk biomass. Overall, the results indicated that three sets of predictive models performed well across the different subtropical forest types (Adj-R2 = 0.42\textendash 0.93, excluding foliage biomass). Forest type-specific models (Adj-R2 = 0.18\textendash 0.93) were generally more accurate than the general model (Adj-R2 = 0.07\textendash 0.79) with the most accurate results obtained for coniferous stands (Adj-R2 = 0.50\textendash 0.93). In addition, LiDAR metrics related to vegetation heights were the strongest predictors of total biomass and its components. This research also illustrates the potential for the synergistic use of DR and FW LiDAR metrics to accurately assess biomass stocks in subtropical forests, which suggest significant potential in research and decision support in sustainable forest management, such as timber harvesting, biofuel characterization and fire hazard analyses.},

In this study, we compared two suites of point cloud metrics and the accuracies of predictive models of forest structural attributes using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data, in a subtropical coastal planted forest of East China. A comparison between UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP metrics was performed across plots among different tree species, heights, and stem densities. The results showed that a higher similarity between the UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP metrics appeared in the dawn redwood plots with greater height and lower stem density. The comparison between the UAV-LiDAR and DAP metrics showed that the metrics of the upper percentiles (r for dawn redwood = 0.95\&ndash;0.96, poplar = 0.94\&ndash;0.95) showed a stronger correlation than the lower percentiles (r = 0.92\&ndash;0.93, 0.90\&ndash;0.92), whereas the metrics of upper canopy return density (r = 0.21\&ndash;0.24, 0.14\&ndash;0.15) showed a weaker correlation than those of lower canopy return density (r = 0.32\&ndash;0.68, 0.31\&ndash;0.52). The Weibull \&alpha; parameter indicated a higher correlation (r = 0.70\&ndash;0.72) than that of the Weibull \&beta; parameter (r = 0.07\&ndash;0.60) for both dawn redwood and poplar plots. The accuracies of UAV-LiDAR (adjusted (Adj)R2 = 0.58\&ndash;0.91, relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE) = 9.03\%\&ndash;24.29\%) predicted forest structural attributes were higher than UAV-DAP (Adj-R2 = 0.52\&ndash;0.83, rRMSE = 12.20\%\&ndash;25.84\%). In addition, by comparing the forest structural attributes between UAV-LiDAR and UAV-DAP predictive models, the greatest difference was found for volume (\&Delta;Adj-R2 = 0.09, \&Delta;rRMSE = 4.20\%), whereas the lowest difference was for basal area (\&Delta;Adj-R2 = 0.03, \&Delta;rRMSE = 0.86\%). This study proved that the UAV-DAP data are useful and comparable to LiDAR for forest inventory and sustainable forest management in planted forests, by providing accurate estimations of forest structural attributes.},

  abstract = {In this study we focused on deciduous managed forests in northwest Italy and investigated relationships between bird diversity and forest descriptors both at the habitat and landscape level through a seasonal, guild-based approach. Birds were censused by point counts in randomly selected plots of 50 m radius. Each census plot was described in habitat structure terms by using the Bitterlich variable plot-radius method. Landscape metrics (both at class- and landscape-level, according to Fragstats' terminology) were measured within 500 m radius circle of each plot using an existing GIS database. We first identified specialist and generalist species according to the presence/absence of each species in relation to habitat structure measurements using generalized additive models (GAMs), then we tested for the effects of habitat and landscape variables on guild parameters (namely, bird species richness, Shannon diversity and abundance) using generalized linear models (GLMs). Our analyses showed that several habitat and landscape predictors affected bird diversity. However, in general, guild parameters relative to specialists were especially influenced by oak biomass (a habitat predictor) and oak core area (a class-level predictor) irrespective of the season, while parameters of generalists were influenced by oak core area in winter and perimeter/area ratio of oak patches in spring. Landscape-level predictors significantly affected winter bird abundance only. Results clearly showed that the retention of native oaks both at the habitat and the landscape level is the key-factor for the conservation of diversity of specialist bird species in deciduous, originally oak-dominated woods. Results also suggest that studies focusing on different periods should be preferred to mono-season surveys and that a guild-based approach should be preferred to an holistic one taking into account all species. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Land-use simulation is a well suited but underutilized tool in this regard. As a case study for the application of land-use simulation to assess the impact of protected areas, we present a scenario analysis exploring conservation options in Canada's western boreal forest. The cumulative effect of multiple natural resource sectors, including oil and gas, forestry, and agriculture, have substantially altered the region's ecosystems in recent decades and elevated risk to wildlife. The evolving state of the region is such that managing risks to biodiversity requires consideration of not only today's but also tomorrow's conditions. We simulated the long-term (50-year) outcomes of land use and protection to caribou, fisher, fish, and resource production in each of 104 watersheds in the 693,345\,km2 study area. Simulated land use caused increased risk to wildlife in response to northwards expansion of resource extraction and expansion of agricultural lands. For each watershed, indicator performance with and without protection were compared to calculate the benefit (avoided ecological loss) and cost (lost opportunity for resource production) of protection. The capacity for protected areas to avoid disturbance varied substantially across watersheds, as did the potential loss of economic opportunity. Focusing protection on cost-effective watersheds made protected area expansion a more efficient strategy for reducing wildlife risk than reducing the overall rate of natural resource production. Heterogeneity in the cost-effectiveness of protection presents an opportunity to balance ecological integrity and economic growth.},

We found that, in contrast to its common image, ecology is still mostly a study of single species (70\% of the studies); while ecosystem and community studies together comprise only a quarter of ecological research. Ecological science is somewhat conservative in its topics of research (about a third of all topics changed significantly through time), as well as in its basic methodologies and approaches. However, the growing proportion of problem-solving studies (from 9\% in the 1980s to 20\% in the 2000 s) may represent a major transition in ecological science in the long run.},

Therefore, increasing understanding of how organisms respond to degradation is essential for management and conservation planning. We were motivated by the need for rapid and practical analytical tools to assess the influence of management and degradation on biodiversity and system state in areas subject to rapid environmental change. We compared bird community composition and size in managed (ejido, i.e., communally owned lands) and unmanaged (national park) forests in the Sierra Tarahumara region, Mexico, using multispecies occupancy models and data from a 2-year breeding bird survey. Unmanaged sites had on average higher species occupancy and richness than managed sites. Most species were present in low numbers as indicated by lower values of detection and occupancy associated with logging-induced degradation. Less than 10\% of species had occupancy probabilities {$>$}0.5, and degradation had no positive effects on occupancy. The estimated metacommunity size of 125 exceeded previous estimates for the region, and sites with mature trees and uneven-aged forest stand characteristics contained the highest species richness. Higher estimation uncertainty and decreases in richness and occupancy for all species, including habitat generalists, were associated with degraded young, even-aged stands. Our findings show that multispecies occupancy methods provide tractable measures of biodiversity and system state and valuable decision support for landholders and managers. These techniques can be used to rapidly address gaps in biodiversity information, threats to biodiversity, and vulnerabilities of species of interest on a landscape level, even in degraded or fast-changing environments. Moreover, such tools may be particularly relevant in the assessment of species richness and distribution in a wide array of habitats.},

Percent growth increase was greater in the small-gap treatment (187.6\% +/- 15.8\%) than in the large-gap treatment (143.4\% +/- 19.3\%), and both treatments had greater percent increases than the unharvested control (9.6\% +/- 5.2\%). Species differed in their response to treatment. Pinus strobus had the greatest absolute increase (large-gap, 52.5 cm(2) +/- year(-1)), while Tsuga canadensis (large-gap, 270\% +/- 71.6\%) and Acer rubrum (small-gap, 262\% +/- 42.4\%) had the greatest percent increases. Growth responses typically diminished with increasing tree size and pretreatment growth rate; however, reserve trees showed greater growth responses than their paired analogues in the control across all initial tree sizes and prior growth rates.

Such retention practices often result in mortality of reserve trees owing to increased exposure'to wind and `gap shock', thereby compromising management objectives. This study investigated the mortality of reserve trees (n = 787) retained over 20 years in the Acadian Forest Ecosystem Research Project (AFERP), a long-term ecological forestry experiment in central Maine, USA. Cumulative mortality across 18 species was very low (8.4\% +/- 3.3\%, mean +/- SD) relative to similar studies throughout the world. Annualized mortality of reserve trees of the two silvicultural systems was 1.1\% for the large-gap treatment and 0.4\% for the small-gap treatment. Cumulative mortality of Tsuga canadensis was lowest (2\%) among species with {$>$}50 individuals, while the cumulative mortality of Thuja occidentalis was highest at 19\%. Over 59\% of cumulative mortality was wind-related. Annualized wind-related mortality of the reserve trees was 0.6\% in the large-gap treatment and 0.2\% in the small-gap treatment. More vigorous trees showed lower mortality rates. Cumulative mortality and wind-related deaths were somewhat higher in large gaps, and were influenced by spatial position within gaps. The non-traditional, expanding-gap, multi-aged silvicultural systems in this study may explain the lower incidence of windthrow and gap shock experienced by reserve trees relative to the annualized mortality rates from studies of similar, though predominantly single-cohort, silvicultural systems.

These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (similar to 104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87\% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30 cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8\%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8\%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R-2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result,-80\% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km(2) and 58.4 km(2), respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6\% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation.

We found a significant correlation between H and S both at global and macro-climate scales, with strongest confidence in the tropics. Hence, two different regression models were compared and discussed to provide a possible pattern of the H\textendash S relation. We suggested that the volume of forest ecosystems should be considered in ecological studies as well as in planning and managing natural sites, although in this first attempt, we cannot definitively prove our hypothesis. Again, high-resolution spatial data could be highly important to confirm the H\textendash S relation, even at different scales.},

In 2011, we studied habitat relationships of a major population breeding in a 128-ha cattail- and bur-reed-dominated impoundment in Quebec. We surveyed for bitterns and recorded habitat parameters at 30 points, making novel use of a small unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to obtain fine-scale land cover data. A model-selection approach based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) determined that breeding density was best predicted by cattail cover in combination with water-vegetation edge density (Akaike weight = 0.88). Breeding density was unrelated to water depth, contrary to a previous study at the site after a dyke breach significantly lowered water levels, suggesting that above a certain depth threshold other habitat preferences take precedence. We recommend that management of created wetlands for Least Bitterns focus on maintaining stable water levels of at least 25 cm on average during the breeding season and manipulating them as required later on in order to promote hemi-marsh conditions. UAS can enhance wetland habitat research and monitoring by improving the precision and efficiency of data collection in the field while reducing disturbance compared to ground-based surveys.},

  abstract = {Context: Spatial variation in abundance is influenced by local- and landscape-level environmental variables, but modeling landscape effects is challenging because the spatial scales of the relationships are unknown. Current approaches involve buffering survey locations with polygons of various sizes and using model selection to identify the best scale. The buffering approach does not acknowledge that the influence of surrounding landscape features should diminish with distance, and it does not yield an estimate of the unknown scale parameters. Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to present an approach that allows for statistical inference about the scales at which landscape variables affect abundance. Methods: Our method uses smoothing kernels to average landscape variables around focal sites and uses maximum likelihood to estimate the scale parameters of the kernels and the effects of the smoothed variables on abundance. We assessed model performance using a simulation study and an avian point count dataset. Results: The simulation study demonstrated that estimators are unbiased and produce correct confidence interval coverage except in the rare case in which there is little spatial autocorrelation in the landscape variable. Canada warbler abundance was more highly correlated with site-level measures of NDVI than landscape-level NDVI, but the reverse was true for elevation. Canada warbler abundance was highest when elevation in the surrounding landscape, defined by an estimated Gaussian kernel, was between 1300 and 1400~m. Conclusions: Our method provides a rigorous way of formally estimating the scales at which landscape variables affect abundance, and it can be embedded within most classes of statistical models.},

Harvesting techniques that retain live trees in the cut block are advocated for sustaining forest biodiversity, but the effects of these practices on amphibians are unknown. We studied red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) in movement trials to assess: 1) how short-term use of residual trees was affected by tree patch size, streams, and neighborhood features 2) whether residual tree patches were used as stepping stones in negotiating cut blocks; 3) the effects of patch size and patch proximity in altering movement paths; and 4) the effects of retention level and patch size on interpatch distance. Residual tree patches were potentially valuable short-term refugia but their value was size dependent. Virtually all frogs released at the base of single trees or inside small tree clusters left within 72 hours, but the proportion leaving decreased curvilinearly with increasing patch size. Frogs were less likely to leave tree patches with a running stream or where neighborhood stream density was high. Residual tree patches did not systematically alter movement paths. Frogs intercepted residual tree patches mostly at random and had to be within 5-20 m of a tree patch before moving to it in greater proportions than expected by chance. However, amphibian movements were biased toward large (0.8 ha) patches and away from small (0.3 ha) patches 50 m away. Our results indicated that residual trees should not be retained singly but should be aggregated in groups between 0.8 ha and 1.5 ha, preferably in stream locations.},

In mixedwood forests, understory conifers such as white spruce are typically destroyed during natural disturbance harvest (NDH). Understory protection (UP) is a harvesting approach that seeks to protect understory conifers during hardwood harvesting in mixedwood forests. While understory protection harvesting has been implemented for over a decade in Alberta, Canada, there has been no assessment of its use by birds. We surveyed birds in UP and NDH harvest blocks, and the nearby unharvested forest, and evaluated differences in species richness and community composition between the three treatment types. We found NDH had significantly higher species richness than unharvested forests, but did not differ from UP. The three treatments all had significantly different avian community compositions, and NDH showed no convergence with the unharvested forest over 15 years post-harvest. However, UP represented an intermediary between NDH and unharvested forests.

  abstract = {Forests managed for timber have an important role to play in conserving global biodiversity. We evaluated the most common timber production systems worldwide in terms of their impact on local species richness by conducting a categorical meta-analysis. We reviewed 287 published studies containing 1008 comparisons of species richness in managed and unmanaged forests and derived management, taxon, and continent specific effect sizes. We show that in terms of local species richness loss, forest management types can be ranked, from best to worse, as follows: selection and retention systems, reduced impact logging, conventional selective logging, clear-cutting, agroforestry, timber plantations, fuelwood plantations. Next, we calculated the economic profitability in terms of the net present value of timber harvesting from 10 hypothetical wood-producing Forest Management Units (FMU) from around the globe. The ranking of management types is altered when the species loss per unit profit generated from the FMU is considered. This is due to differences in yield, timber species prices, rotation cycle length and production costs. We thus conclude that it would be erroneous to dismiss or prioritize timber production regimes, based solely on their ranking of alpha diversity impacts.},

Understanding how biodiversity will respond to RIL demands assessments that include interactions among initial site conditions, specific harvest techniques, and responses of species that can be compared across varied forest types and regions. We assessed the short-term effects of RIL on 10 avian species in logged and unlogged portions of two concessions in Acre State, Brazil. We performed 460 point-count surveys and estimated variation in occupancy using a removal model that accounts for imperfect detection. Species were selected to include birds with contrasting expected responses to logging activities. We also conducted vegetation assessments at bird sampling locations, paying particular attention to bamboo (Guadua spp.) structure and distribution due to its dominance in forests of the region and high importance as a habitat component for Amazonian birds. Occupancy of four species varied between RIL and unlogged areas and was highly influenced by the percentage of bamboo present. Overall, bird responses to logging was greater where percent cover of bamboo was highest and, for two species, elevated occupancy was closely associated with elevated bamboo density. Bamboo dominance did not differ between logged and unlogged areas; our analysis indicated that this may have resulted from avoidance of bamboo stands by logging crews. This potential behavior, in turn, insured that bamboo refuges were maintained within logged areas, aiding species otherwise negatively affected by logging. Our work suggested how important logger behavior can be in influencing the structure of wildlife habitat under RIL management and that bird responses to logging, both positive and negative, are strongly influenced by local forest conditions.

Here, we address several fundamental questions about the origins of acoustic communication in terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods), using phylogenetic methods. We show that origins of acoustic communication are significantly associated with nocturnal activity. We find that acoustic communication does not increase diversification rates, a surprising result given the many speciation-focused studies of frog calls and bird songs. We also demonstrate that the presence of acoustic communication is strongly conserved over time. Finally, we find that acoustic communication evolved independently in most major tetrapod groups, often with remarkably ancient origins (\textasciitilde 100\textendash 200 million years ago). Overall, we show that the role of ecology in shaping signal evolution applies to surprisingly deep timescales, whereas the role of signal evolution in diversification may not.

Tree retention is an alternative practice that maintains greater structural diversity, but its effects on climate change impacts relative to conventional harvesting are largely unexplored. By integrating field measurements from 12 forest stands with modelling approaches, we investigated the post-harvest effects on radiative forcing of tree retention in a Swedish boreal pine forest. In the near-term, impacts from carbon fluxes and surface albedo were of the same order of magnitude but with opposite sign (warming for carbon and cooling for albedo), with a net warming effect. In the long-term, the net effect turns to cooling, as the forest becomes a strong carbon sink. Retention had a significant effect on climate in the near-term, where differences between the various retention levels are more evident. At increasing tree retention, warming impacts from carbon fluxes tend to decrease, but cooling contributions from surface albedo are less pronounced. Balancing these effects, we find a net climate warming that increases with tree retention.},

  abstract = {1. Monitoring the impacts of anthropogenic threats and interventions to mitigate these threats is key to understanding how to best conserve biodiversity. Ecologists use many different study designs to monitor such impacts. Simpler designs lacking controls (e.g. Before-After (BA) and After) or pre-impact data (e.g. Control-Impact (CI)) are considered to be less robust than more complex designs (e.g. Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) or Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)). However, we lack quantitative estimates of how much less accurate simpler study designs are in ecology. Understanding this could help prioritize research and weight studies by their design's accuracy in meta-analysis and evidence assessment. 2. We compared how accurately five study designs estimated the true effect of a simulated environmental impact that caused a step-change response in a popula-tion's density. We derived empirical estimates of several simulation parameters from 47 ecological datasets to ensure our simulations were realistic. We measured design performance by determining the percentage of simulations where: (a) the true effect fell within the 95\% Confidence Intervals of effect size estimates, and (b) each design correctly estimated the true effect's direction and magnitude. We also considered how sample size affected their performance. 3. We demonstrated that BACI designs performed: 1.3-1.8 times better than RCTs; 2.9-4.2 times versus BA; 3.2-4.6 times versus CI; and 7.1-10.1 times versus After designs (depending on sample size), when correctly estimating true effect's direction and magnitude to within {$\pm$}30\%. Although BACI designs suffered from low power at small sample sizes, they outperformed other designs for almost all performance measures. Increasing sample size improved BACI design accuracy, but only increased the precision of simpler designs around biased estimates. 4. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that more investment in more robust designs is needed in ecology since inferences from simpler designs, even with large sample sizes may be misleading. Facilitating this requires longer-term funding and stronger research-practice partnerships. We also propose 'accuracy weights' and demonstrate how they can weight studies in three recent meta-analyses by},

  abstract = {The frequency and severity of forest fires, coupled with changes in spatial and temporal precipitation and temperature patterns, are likely to severely affect the characteristics of forest and permafrost patterns in boreal eco-regions. Forest fires, however, are also an ecological factor in how forest ecosystems form and function, as they affect the rate and characteristics of tree recruitment. A better understanding of fire regimes and forest recovery patterns in different environmental and climatic conditions will improve the management of sustainable forests by facilitating the process of forest resilience. Remote sensing has been identified as an effective tool for preventing and monitoring forest fires, as well as being a potential tool for understanding how forest ecosystems respond to them. However, a number of challenges remain before remote sensing practitioners will be able to better understand the effects of forest fires and how vegetation responds afterward. This article attempts to provide a comprehensive review of current research with respect to remotely sensed data and methods used to model post-fire effects and forest recovery patterns in boreal forest regions. The review reveals that remote sensing-based monitoring of post-fire effects and forest recovery patterns in boreal forest regions is not only limited by the gaps in both field data and remotely sensed data, but also the complexity of far-northern fire regimes, climatic conditions and environmental conditions. We expect that the integration of different remotely sensed data coupled with field campaigns can provide an important data source to support the monitoring of post-fire effects and forest recovery patterns. Additionally, the variation and stratification of pre-and post-fire vegetation and environmental conditions should be considered to achieve a reasonable, operational model for monitoring post-fire effects and forest patterns in boreal regions. \textcopyright{} 2013 by the authors.},

However, field-based measurements of vegetation structure can be time consuming, costly, and difficult to undertake in areas that are remote and/or contain rough terrain. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is an active remote sensing technology that can quantify three-dimensional vegetation structure over large areas and thus holds promise for examining wildlife-habitat relationships. We used discrete-return airborne lidar data acquired over the Black Hills Experimental Forest in South Dakota, USA in combination with field-collected vegetation and bird data to assess the utility of lidar data in quantifying vegetation structural characteristics that relate to avian diversity, density, and occurrence. Indices of foliage height diversity calculated from lidar data were positively and significantly correlated with indices of bird species diversity, with the highest correlations observed when foliage height diversity categories contained proportionally more foliage layers near the forest floor ({$<$} 5 m). In addition, lidar-derived indices of vegetation volume were significantly correlated with bird density. Using lidar-derived vegetation height data in combination with multispectral IKONOS data, we delineated five general habitat types within the study area according to the presence of prominent vegetation layers at lower levels of the forest and predominant tree type (deciduous or conifer). Habitat type delineations were tested by examining the occurrence and relative density of two bird species common to the study area that prefer lower level vegetation for foraging and nesting. Dark-eyed Juncos were significantly associated with the 0.5-2.0 m high vegetation layer in pine-dominated stands, and Warbling Vireos were significantly associated with this same layer in aspen-dominated stands. These results demonstrate that discrete-return lidar can be an effective tool to remotely quantify vegetation structural attributes important to birds, and may be enhanced when used in combination with spectral data. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Landsat data are a key remote sensing dataset for monitoring forest disturbance and there recently has been major growth in the development of disturbance mapping algorithms. Many of these algorithms take advantage of the high temporal data volume to mine subtle signals in Landsat time series, but as those signals become subtler, they are more likely to be mixed with noise in Landsat data. This study examines the similarity among seven different algorithms in their ability to map the full range of magnitudes of forest disturbance over six different Landsat scenes distributed across the conterminous US. The maps agreed very well in terms of the amount of undisturbed forest over time; however, for the \textasciitilde 30\% of forest mapped as disturbed in a given year by at least one algorithm, there was little agreement about which pixels were affected. Algorithms that targeted higher-magnitude disturbances exhibited higher omission errors but lower commission errors than those targeting a broader range of disturbance magnitudes. These results suggest that a user of any given forest disturbance map should understand the map's strengths and weaknesses (in terms of omission and commission error rates), with respect to the disturbance targets of interest.},

Most regionalisations are made based on subjective criteria, and can not be readily revised, leading to outstanding questions with respect to how to optimally develop and define them. Advances in remote sensing technology, and big data analysis approaches, provide new opportunities for regionalisations, especially in terms of productivity patterns through both photosynthesis and structural surrogates. Here we show that global terrestrial productivity dynamics can be captured by Dynamics Habitat Indices (DHIs) and we conduct a regionalisation based on the DHIs using a two-stage multivariate clustering approach. Encouragingly, the derived clusters are more homogeneous in terms of species richness of three key taxa, and of canopy height, than a conventional regionalisation. We conclude with discussing the benefits of these remotely derived clusters for biodiversity assessments and conservation. The clusters based on the DHIs explained more variance, and greater within-region homogeneity, compared to conventional regionalisations for species richness of both amphibians and mammals, and were comparable in the case of birds. Structure as defined by global tree height was also better defined by productivity driven clusters than conventional regionalisations. These results suggest that ecological regionalisations based on remotely sensed metrics have clear advantages over conventional regionalisations for certain applications, and they are also more easily updated.},

While the implications of landscape connectivity are self-evident for conservation, they are also important for physical geography since a proper understanding of landscape patterns and processes allows for better landscape management practices, which are at the core of geography. This paper presents a review of the literature based on 162 publications from 2000 to 2013, in which we evaluated the current state and recent advances in the integration of landscape connectivity in the identification and planning of conservation areas. The literature review and data analysis were based on a database organized into five categories: General information, study areas, research objectives, research methods in connectivity studies, and integration of connectivity with conservation. We found a substantial increase in the number of publications relating to connectivity and conservation from 2008 to 2013. Least cost analysis was the method most commonly applied. We found no implementation of landscape connectivity proposals generated by the studies (e.g. potential corridors) into real landscape elements to ensure the permanence and functionality of ecosystems. We identified four important niches for potential future research projects: a) connectivity and climate change, b) contribution of connectivity studies to restoration planning, c) connectivity and land cover/land use change modeling and planning, d) contribution of connectivity analysis in the provision of ecosystem services across landscapes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {PARK2 and PINK1 gene mutations are involved in recessive early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). In order to determine the causative mutations in three affected sibs from a consanguineous Sudanese family with EOPD, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was performed and revealed that the patients were homozygous for a deletion of PINK1 exons 4 to 8. Breakpoint analysis revealed a complex rearrangement combining a large deletion and the insertion of a sequence duplicated from the DDOST gene intron 2, located near the PINK1 gene. As breakpoint sequences displayed only three base pairs of homology, this rearrangement may result from Fork Stalling and Template Switching mechanism. This third large rearrangement of PINK1 enlarges the mutation spectrum and, together with recent published data in Tunisian patients with EOPD, points out that PINK1 gene analysis, including search for large rearrangement, should be considered in early onset recessive PD patients, particularly those from Arab origin.},

  abstract = {Forested landscapes in the upper Fraser River watershed face increasing fragmentation from forest harvesting. The resultant edge effects may have a major impact on canopy lichen communities in the surrounding forest matrix. Growth rate responses of large and small thalli of Lobaria pulmonaria were evaluated in transplant experiments conducted in old-growth cedar-Hemlock forest stands located adjacent to clearcut harvest blocks (high-contrast ``hard\{''\} edges) and variable-retention harvest blocks (low-contrast ``soft\{''\} edges). Growth response was also assessed in transplants onto retained trees in the variable-retention harvest blocks. There was little observed difference in growth rate responses of large thalli between ``hard\{''\} and ``soft\{''\} edges. In fact, contrary to our initial hypothesis, growth rates of large L. pulmonaria thalli were enhanced near forest edges (25\% cumulative growth rate over 2-year study period at 7.5 m from clearcut edges compared to only 17\% at forest interior sites). Growth rates of large thalli were somewhat reduced at the immediate edge of clearcuts, but not of variable-retention blocks. Optimal canopy openness for growth of large L pulmonaria thalli fell broadly between 30 and 40\%, while for small L. pulmonaria thalli was closer to 30\%. Growth rates of small L. pulmonaria thalli placed on ``soft\{''\} edge transects were also greatest at or near stand edges and on retained trees in harvest blocks. However, in the ``hard\{''\} edge transects growth rate ` s ` of small L pulmonaria thalli show little or no enhancement near edges. Repeated measures analysis of variance confirms a significant treatment effect (\{''\}soft\{''\} versus ``hard\{''\} edges) for the small Lobaria thalli. These findings suggest that edge effects near clearcuts (hard edges) may have little impact on previously established large L pulmonaria thalli. However, they also suggest that future colonization of remnant forest stands near clearcut edges by small L. pulmonaria thalli may be delayed until edge effects are moderated. The adoption of variable-retention harvesting was demonstrated to be an effective means of reducing the impact of edge effects on both large and small L. pulmonaria thalli. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Old-growth cedar-hemlock forests of the interior wet-belt of British Columbia are rich in abundance and diversity of canopy lichens, but are subject to forest harvesting. If these distinctive canopy lichen communities are to be conserved, it is important to learn how they are affected by forestry practices, including partial-cutting techniques designed to retain old-growth attributes. The retention of canopy lichens after 30 and 70\% partial-cut harvesting (immediate post-harvest and 2-year post-harvest measurements) was examined using direct canopy access methods (tree climbing) in two old-growth interior cedar-hemlock forest stands of the upper Fraser River valley. Mean lichen loading was generally lower in all treatment areas, including control sites, 2 years after harvesting. However, three of four lichen-sampling groups (cyanolichen, foliose, and Bryoria group lichens) did not show significant treatment effects (total lichen loading) by harvesting type (30, 70 or 100\% retention), when data sets were standardized against initial post-harvest lichen loading. Only in Alectoria group lichens were treatment effects observed. Although cyanolichen loading was not significantly different in retained trees in most harvest blocks, many thalli, especially those near south-facing edges, were discolored, suggesting that future cyanolichen loading may be lower within partial-cut harvest blocks. Litterfall in general was greater during 2001/2002 than 2002/2003, even in the control units, suggesting weather-related differences between years. For Alectoria, there appeared to be a treatment-related pulse of litterfall that was more pronounced in the 70\% removal than the 30\% removal treatment unit. Deposition patterns of litterfall components in relation to edges of openings indicated a heightened level of Alectoria litterfall along edges. Treatment-related differences were absent or weak in other groups, and cyanolichen litterfall did not differ between years in any study area/treatment unit combination. These findings suggest that lichen retention in the residual stand of both partial-cut treatments was adequate to meet management goals, but also point to the necessity of future monitoring, as other edge effects (e.g. microclimate changes) influence future lichen growth and mortality.

For the partial harvest treatments (10\%, 20\%, 50\%, 75\%) sample plots were located in the partially harvested (retention) strips as well as in the intervening machine corridors used by the harvesting equipment. The understory plant community was significantly influenced by the gradient of retention level. The cover of understory vegetation, especially graminoids, increased with increasing harvesting intensity for the retention strips and overall considering both plots types. Species richness was unaffected by retention level but did decrease as tree density increased. Lower levels of retention lead to increased abundance of early successional, shade-intolerant species. The results suggest a threshold in understory response to GTR harvesting between the 10\% and 20\% retention treatments. In terms of understory cover and composition, machine corridors within partially harvested forests resembled clearcuts. The results suggest that retaining more than 10\% during GTR harvesting could have significant benefits in terms of maintaining understory plant communities more similar to unharvested reference forest. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Forest harvesting reduces mean stand age and dead wood amount. Among species dependent upon older forests and dead wood, primary excavators such as woodpeckers play an important ecological role by providing cavities for many other species. Conservation of these species thus requires striking a balance between timber harvesting and dead wood supply, especially under moderate natural disturbance regimes. In this study, we quantified habitat use in two closely-related, sympatric species: Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and American Three-toed (P. dorsalis) Woodpecker, in the highlands of northern New Brunswick, Canada. Natural fires are rare in this ecoregion and forest harvesting is the main agent of landscape change, along with infrequent outbreaks of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Based on its habitat use patterns in other ecoregions, we hypothesized that Black-backed Woodpecker would select nest sites in mature coniferous forest stands and we expected that it would achieve a higher nest survival rate in forest stands than within, or at the edge of, cutblocks. Owing to sample size limitations for American Three-toed Woodpecker, statistical analyses were restricted to its occurrence patterns. Both species co-occurred, and there was no difference in detectability following conspecific and heterospecific playbacks. Contrary to our prediction, Black-backed Woodpecker selected nest sites with higher proportions of recently cut areas within 50 m than at randomly selected sites. Black-backed Woodpecker selected cutblocks for nesting when suitable snags were available and mature forest stands were present nearby as foraging habitat. For the species to persist in this landscape, the supply of snags must be continuous and forest stands must be sufficiently mature to host saproxylic insects.},

  abstract = {Balancing economic, ecological, and social values has long been a challenge in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, where conflict over timber harvest and old-growth habitat on public lands has been contentious for the past several decades. The Northwest Forest Plan, adopted two decades ago to guide management on federal lands, is currently being revised as the region searches for a balance between sustainable timber yields and habitat for sensitive species. In addition, climate change imposes a high degree of uncertainty on future forest productivity, sustainability of timber harvest, wildfire risk, and species habitat. We evaluated the long-term, landscape-scale trade-offs among carbon (C) storage, timber yield, and old forest habitat given projected climate change and shifts in forest management policy across 2.1 million hectares of forests in the Oregon Coast Range. Projections highlight the divergence between private and public lands under business-as-usual forest management, where private industrial forests are heavily harvested and many public (especially federal) lands increase C and old forest over time but provide little timber. Three alternative management scenarios altering the amount and type of timber harvest show widely varying levels of ecosystem C and old-forest habitat. On federal lands, ecological forestry practices also allowed a simultaneous increase in old forest and natural early-seral habitat. The ecosystem C implications of shifts away from current practices were large, with current practices retaining up to 105Tg more C than the alternative scenarios by the end of the century. Our results suggest climate change is likely to increase forest productivity by 30-41\% and total ecosystem C storage by 11-15\% over the next century as warmer winter temperatures allow greater forest productivity in cooler months. These gains in C storage are unlikely to be offset by wildfire under climate change, due to the legacy of management and effective fire suppression. Our scenarios of future conditions can inform policy makers, land managers, and the public about the potential effects of land management alternatives, climate change, and the trade-offs that are inherent to management and policy in the region.},

  abstract = {Variable-retention harvesting in lodgepole pine offers an alternative to conventional, even-aged management. This harvesting technique promotes structural complexity and age-class diversity in residual stands and promotes resilience to disturbance. We examined fuel loads and potential fire behaviour 12 years after two modes of variable-retention harvesting (dispersed and aggregated retention patterns) crossed by post-harvest prescribed fire (burned or unburned) in central Montana. Results characterise 12-year post-treatment fuel loads. We found greater fuel load reduction in treated than untreated stands, namely in the 10- and 100-h classes (P=0.002 and 0.049 respectively). Reductions in 1-h (P{$<$}0.001), 10-h (P=0.008) and 1000-h (P=0.014) classes were greater in magnitude for unburned than burned treatments. Fire behaviour modelling incorporated the regenerating seedling cohort into the surface fuel complex. Our analysis indicates greater surface fireline intensity in treated than untreated stands (P{$<$}0.001), and in unburned over burned stands (P=0.001) in dry, windy weather. Although potential fire behaviour in treated stands is predicted to be more erratic, within-stand structural variability reduces probability of crown fire spread. Overall, results illustrate trade-offs between potential fire attributes that should be acknowledged with variable-retention harvesting.},

  abstract = {Structurally diverse forests provide resilience to an array of disturbances and are a mainstay of multiple-resource management. Silviculture based on natural disturbance can increase structural heterogeneity while providing other ecological and economic benefits. One useful silvicultural tool for promoting structural heterogeneity is retention harvesting, whereby a portion of forest stands are left unlogged, transitioning even-aged stands to multi-aged. We report stand and tree dynamics 11 years after retention harvest in a central Montana Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forest with evidence for a mixed-severity fire regime. Treatments were implemented on 16 experimental units with prescriptions for two 50\% overstory basal area retention patterns (Aggregated and Dispersed) crossed with two levels of prescribed fire use (Burned and Unburned). The aim of this study was to identify (1) how retention harvest spatial pattern affects stand dynamics, (2) if stand dynamics after retention treatments are more simply attributable to tree size and competition, or if retention pattern affects dynamics beyond those measures, and (3) how stem and basal area heterogeneity varied over the 11-year measurement period. Retention pattern affected overstory density, growth, mortality, and regeneration density and stocking. After controlling for the fine-scale factors of tree size and competition, overstory mortality, regeneration stocking, and regeneration height growth did not vary by treatment-scale factors. Fine-scaled factors explained significant variation in overstory basal area growth, but at the scale of experimental units, growth was also greater in Dispersed treatments. Prescribed burning interacted with retention pattern to influence overstory tree growth, increased overstory mortality, and increased regeneration height growth. Overstory heterogeneity (e.g., in basal area) degraded more rapidly in treatments with the Dispersed spatial pattern than Aggregated. This study evaluates novel silvicultural treatments in a lodgepole pine forest and highlights the tradeoffs between retention patterns combined with broadcast burning on forest change. Our results are useful for planning silvicultural treatments in multiple-use forests designed to promote structural complexity and resilience to disturbances.},

We reduced the seven\textemdash stage model of Crouse et al. (1987) to a five\textemdash stage model and performed sensitivity analyses on the matrix. The most sensitive matrix parameters were those dealing with survival while remaining in a stage, rather than growth from one stage to the next or reproductive output. Population growth rate was most sensitive to survival in the large juvenile stage, followed by small juvenile survival. Large juveniles are the most common size class among stranded dead turtles found on beaches; 70\textemdash 80\% of strandings are thought to be related to trawl fisheries. Simulations of our loggerhead model based on estimated effects of TED regulations on stage\textemdash specific survivorship suggested that southeastern US loggerhead populations should increase, but rather slowly. If TEDs were required during the shrimping season in offshore areas only (as they were from 1990 to 1992), 70 yr or more would be required for the simulated population to increase by an order of magnitude. Recent estimates of TED effects from South Carolina strandings data suggest a similar recovery rate. Good compliance with regulations requiring TEDs year\textemdash round in all waters could allow the population to increase nearly twice as fast as that expected under the "seasonal offshore" regulations. We also used a Leslie matrix version of the model to illustrate the expected transient response in the numbers of females expected on nesting beaches (due to shifting age\textemdash size structures with TED use). Rather than a monotonic increase, we expect an initial increase in the number of nesting females, followed by a leveling off or slight decline (perhaps 10\textemdash 15 yr from now), followed by another increase. The magnitude of the projected population increase will depend upon the actual increases in stage\textemdash specific survivorship due to TED regulations. New, or compensatory, sources of mortality could slow or reverse this projected recovery.},

Our specific concern is the provision of appropriate landcover data for various national modelling initiatives. Modelling efforts to date have used either remote-sensed data, which was available for the entire boreal region, or forest resource inventory (FRI) data, which has greater spatial and thematic resolution but was limited to regional scale studies (e.g., an individual tenure area or province). Over the past decades, a number of studies have demonstrated the value of FRI data in modeling wildfire, forest bird habitat and abundance, stand dynamics, and landscape pattern metrics, all at large spatial extents. Collectively, these studies acquired a large sample of the available FRI in Canada, and it became clear that a cooperative venture to assemble a comprehensive, integrated coverage of Canada's FRI would be feasible. This cooperation has resulted in the assembly of a virtually complete set of extant digital FRIs from all Canadian jurisdictions, providing extensive coverage of the boreal region. Models based on this digital forest inventory database have spatial and thematic resolution commensurate with forest management planning and are thus of great utility for multiple objectives, including the evaluation of management scenarios at large spatial and temporal scales. This national product should have broad applicability and relevance to forest managers, researchers in government and academia, and members of stakeholder organizations.},

Using a small, unpiloted aerial system (UAS) to acquire aerial photographs and processing theses using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, three-dimensional models were produced describing the vegetation structure of semi-arid ecosystems at seven sites across a grass-to shrub transition zone. This approach yielded ultra-fine ({$<$}1 cm(2)) spatial resolution canopy height models over landscape-levels (10 ha), which resolved individual grass tussocks just a few cm(3) in volume. Canopy height cumulative distributions for each site illustrated ecologically-significant differences in ecosystem structure. Strong coefficients of determination (r(2) from 0.64 to 0.95) supported prediction of above-ground biomass from canopy volume. Canopy volumes, above-ground biomass and carbon stocks were shown to be sensitive to spatial changes in the structure of vegetation communities. The grain of data produced and sensitivity of this approach is invaluable to capture even subtle differences in the structure (and therefore function) of these heterogeneous ecosystems subject to rapid environmental change. The results demonstrate how products from inexpensive UAS coupled with SfM photogrammetry can produce ultra-fine grain biophysical data products, which have the potential to revolutionise scientific understanding of ecology in ecosystems with either spatially or temporally discontinuous canopy cover.

  abstract = {Recent emphasis on increasing structural complexity and species diversity reflective of natural ecosystems through the use of retention harvesting approaches is coinciding with increased demand for forest-derived bioenergy feedstocks, largely sourced through the removal of harvest residues associated with whole-tree harvest. Uncertainties about the consequences of such approaches prompted us to examine the combined impacts of aggregated overstory retention and harvest residue retention on the composition and density of regeneration following biomass harvests on four operational-scale (40 ha) study areas dominated by Populus tremuloides Michx. in northern Minnesota. Whole-tree harvest had no statistically significant effects on initial (2-year) regeneration densities, including root suckers, sprouts, and seedlings relative to conventional, stem-only harvest. The density of shrub stems was also unaffected by harvest residue retention. Despite having a lower mean leaf area index than intact forest controls, aggregates maintained comparable densities of the four most common tree species, individually, as well as all tree species combined. The composition of regeneration within aggregates differed from surrounding harvested areas as expected, but this increase in complexity at the stand scale was achieved without diminishing P. tremuloides densities in the edge area (0-5 m) surrounding aggregates 2 years after harvest. These initial findings suggest even small aggregates of overstory reserves may achieve basic objectives related to structural complexity and sustaining shade-tolerant tree species in harvested units without compromising regeneration objectives for less tolerant species.},

  abstract = {Vegetation patterns at the landscape scale are shaped by myriad processes and historical events, and understanding the relative importance of these processes aids in predicting current and future plant distributions. To quantify the influence of different environmental and anthropogenic patterns on observed vegetation patterns, we used simultaneous autoregressive modeling to analyze data collected by the Carnegie Airborne Observatory over Santa Cruz Island (SCI; California, USA). SCI is a large continental island, and its limited suite of species and well documented land use history allowed us to consider many potential determinants of vegetation patterns, such as topography, substrate, and historical grazing intensity. As a metric of vegetation heterogeneity, we used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) stratified into three vegetation height classes using LiDAR (short, medium, and tall). In the SAR models topography and substrate type were important controls, together explaining 8-15 \% of the total variation in NDVI, but historical grazing and spatial autocorrelation were also key components of the models, together explaining 17-21 \% of the variation in NDVI. Optimal spatial autocorrelation distances in the short and medium height vegetation models (600-700 m) were similar to the home range sizes of two crucial seed dispersers on the island-the island fox (Urocyon littoralis santacruzae) and the island scrub-jay (Aphelocoma insularis)-suggesting that these animals may be important drivers of the island's vegetation patterns. This study highlights the importance of dynamic processes like dispersal limitation and disturbance history in determining present-day vegetation patterns.},

One assumption inherent in this model is that the animal populations at each sampled location are closed with respect to migration, births, and deaths throughout the study. In the past this has been verified solely by biological arguments related to the study design as no statistical verification was available. In this article, we propose a generalization of the\hspace{0.6em}N-mixture model that can be used to formally test the closure assumption. Additionally, when applied to an open metapopulation, the generalized model provides estimates of population dynamics parameters and yields abundance estimates that account for imperfect detection probability and do not require the closure assumption. A simulation study shows these abundance estimates are less biased than the abundance estimate obtained from the original\hspace{0.6em}N-mixture model. The proposed model is then applied to two data sets of avian point counts. The first example demonstrates the closure test on a single-season study of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and the second uses the proposed model to estimate the population dynamics parameters and yearly abundance of American robins (Turdus migratorius) from a multi-year study.},

To address this challenge, a range of adaptation approaches have been proposed centered on conferring ecosystem resilience and adaptive capacity; however, considerable uncertainty exists regarding how to translate these broad and often theoretical adaptation frameworks to on-the-ground practice. Complicating this issue has been movement away, in some cases, from other recent advances in forest management, namely ecological silviculture strategies that often focus on restoration. In this paper, we highlight the areas of compatibility and conflict between these two frameworks by reviewing the four principles of ecological silviculture (continuity, complexity and diversity, timing, and context) from the perspective of global change adaptation. We conclude that given many commonalities between the outcomes of ecological silviculture and conditions conferring adaptive capacity, the four principles remain a relevant starting point for guiding operationalization of often theoretical adaptation strategies.},

Many of the changes in management context and forest conditions occurring over the last 30 years were not anticipated and have resulted in an increase in silvicultural systems that integrate ecological and noneconomic social values on public lands.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is the current standard for these measurements but requires bulky instruments mounted on commercial aircraft. Here we demonstrate that high spatial resolution 3D measurements of vegetation structure and spectral characteristics can be produced by applying open-source computer vision algorithms to ordinary digital photographs acquired using inexpensive hobbyist aerial platforms. Digital photographs were acquired using a kite aerial platform across two 2.25 ha test sites in Baltimore, MD, USA. An open-source computer vision algorithm generated 3D point cloud datasets with RGB spectral attributes from the photographs and these were geocorrected to a horizontal precision of {$<$}1.5 m (root mean square error; RMSE) using ground control points (GCPs) obtained from local orthophotographs and public domain digital terrain models (DTM). Point cloud vertical precisions ranged from 0.6 to 4.3 m RMSE depending on the precision of GCP elevations used for geocorrection. Tree canopy height models (CHMs) generated from both computer vision and LiDAR point clouds across sites adequately predicted field-measured tree heights, though LiDAR showed greater precision (R-2 {$>$} 0.82) than computer vision (R-2 {$>$} 0.64), primarily because of difficulties observing terrain under closed canopy forest. Results confirm that computer vision can support ultra-low-cost, user-deployed high spatial resolution 3D remote sensing of vegetation structure.},

Deer mouse abundance was greater along pipeline transects with greater vegetation recovery. Within the forest, irrespective of vegetation recovery on pipelines, meadow voles and deer mice increased near edges. Red-backed voles showed a mixed (i.e., neutral or positive) response to edge. Vegetation variables (i.e., canopy type and cover, ground cover, stem counts, and volume of downed woody material) were important predictors of small-mammal abundance in the forest, but they could not fully account for observed edge effects.

For birds in particular, survey methods have been tested extensively using point counts and sound recording surveys. Here, we review the latest evidence for this taxon within the frame of a systematic map. We compare sampling effectiveness of these two survey methods, the output variables they produce, and their practicality. When assessed against the standard of point counts, autonomous sound recording prove to be a powerful tool that samples at least just as many species. This technology can monitor birds in an exhaustive, standardized and verifiable way. Moreover, sound recorders give access to entire soundscapes from which new data types can be derived (vocal activity, acoustic indices\ldots ). Variables such as abundance, density, occupancy, or species richness can be obtained to yield data sets that are comparable to and compatible with point counts. Finally, autonomous sound recorders allow investigations at high temporal and spatial resolution and coverage, which are more cost-effective and cannot be achieved by human observations alone, even though small-scale studies might be more cost-effective when carried out with point counts. Sound recorders can be deployed in many places, they are more scalable and reliable, making them the better choice for bird surveys in an increasingly data-driven time. We provide an overview of currently available recorders and discuss their specifications to guide future study designs.},

Yet imperfect detection and other phenomena that cause zero inflation can induce estimation error and obscure ecological patterns. Recent statistical advances provide an increasingly diverse array of analytical approaches for estimating population size to address these phenomena. We examine how detection error and zero inflation in count data inform the choice of analytical method for estimating population size of unmarked individuals that are not uniquely identified. We review two established (GLMs and distance sampling) and nine emerging methods that use N-mixture models (Royle-Nichols model, and basic, zero inflated, temporary emigration, beta-binomial, generalized open-population, spatially explicit, single visit and multispecies) to estimate abundance of unmarked populations, focusing on their requirements and how each method accounts for imperfect detection and zero inflation. Eight of the emerging methods can account for both imperfect detection and additional variation in population size in the forms of non-occupancy, temporary emigration, correlated detection and population dynamics. Methods differ in sampling design requirements (e.g. count vs. detection/non-detection data, single vs. multiple visits, covariate data), and their suitability for a particular study will depend on the characteristics of the study species, scale and objectives of the study, and financial and logistical considerations. Most emerging methods were developed over the past decade, so their efficacy is still under study, and additional statistical advances are likely to occur.},

Paired males were older than unpaired males and male mass was related to age. However, males paired with females were not significantly different in body mass from those males caught alone. Wounds and scars resulting from fights between males began at about 6 years of age and peaked at about 17 and 20 years of age, respectively. The frequency of broken canines in males, presumably due to increased male-male conflicts, increased with age but showed little increase in females. The wide range of male size in male-female pairs and the age-related signs of injury suggest that male polar bears engage in both scramble competition and contest competition for access to breeding females.

Var-iation in the acoustic properties of songs is thought to be affected by the mechanics of sound production as well as by features of the habitat that affect sound transmission. To determine whether these mechanisms contribute to song variation, I compare patterns of mor-phological and habitat variation with variation in song structure among populations of white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leuco-phrys) at two time points separated by 35 years. Among contem-porary (2005) populations, vegetation density and bill size explain significant variation in song structure. The direction of change in song structure between 1970 and 2005 is also consistent with the direction of change in vegetation density. These findings suggest that variation in factors that affect signal production and transmission explains significant variation in white-crowned sparrow song.},

  abstract = {The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) (MPB) has infested and killed millions of hectares of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm) forests in British Columbia, Canada, over the past decade. It is now spreading out of its native range into the Canadian boreal forest, with unknown social, economic and ecological consequences. This review explores the ramifications of the MPB epidemic with respect to mid-term timber supply, forest growth, structure and composition, vegetation diversity, forest fire, climate change, and ecosystem resilience. Research confirms that, in British Columbia, all of these variables are more significantly impacted when salvage logging is used as management response to the outbreak. We conclude that appropriate management in response to MPB is essential to ensuring ecologically resilient future forests and reliable mid-term timber supplies for affected human communities. We highlight knowledge gaps and avenues for research to advance our understanding in support of sustainable post-disturbance forest management policies in British Columbia and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {After affecting millions of hectares of pine forests in western Canada, the mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonous ponderosae Hopkins) is spreading out of its native range and into Canada's boreal forest. Impacts of outbreaks can be environmental, economic, and social, and an ecosystem services (ES) viewpoint provides a useful perspective for an integrated approach to assessing these impacts and may help to identify how possible management strategies could minimize these impacts. In this regards, a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem functions and socioeconomic factors that have been impacted by the current outbreaks in western Canada was carried out to facilitate a more general ES assessment. In addition to timber production, current MPB outbreaks have negative effects on provisioning services (water supply and food production) and aesthetic cultural services, while effects on regulating services (carbon and forest fire) are still in debate. Among the supporting services, nutrient cycling and aquatic habitat showed short-and long-term negative effects, while terrestrial habitat showed a mostly positive response. The overall impact on ES may be more severe if salvage logging is practiced as a post-MPB forest management strategy. The outcomes of this study may help to identify areas of greatest socioecological vulnerability to MPB and identify knowledge gaps and avenues for research to advance the ES framework for MPB outbreak management.},

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the de-facto standard for measuring three-dimensional forest structure, but digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has emerged as a viable and economical alternative. We compared the performance of LiDAR and DAP data for characterizing canopy openings and no-openings across a 1-km2 expanse of boreal forest in northern Alberta, Canada. Structural openings in canopy cover were delineated using three canopy height model (CHM) alternatives, from (i) LiDAR, (ii) DAP, and (iii) a LiDAR/DAP hybrid. From a point-based detectability perspective, the LiDAR CHM produced the best results (87\% overall accuracy), followed by the hybrid and DAP models (47\% and 46\%, respectively). The hybrid and DAP CHMs experienced large errors of omission (9-53\%), particularly with small openings up to 20m2, which are an important element of boreal forest structure. By missing these, DAP and hybrid datasets substantially under-reported the total area of openings across our site (152,470 m2 and 159,848 m2, respectively) compared to LiDAR (245,920 m2). Our results illustrate DAP's sensitivity to occlusions, mismatched tie points, and other optical challenges inherent to using structure-from-motion workflows in complex forest scenes. These under-documented constraints currently limit the technology's capacity to fully characterize canopy structure. For now, we recommend that operational use of DAP in forests be limited to mapping large canopy openings, and area-based attributes that are well-documented in the literature.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. Abstract. Bird community response to both landscape-scale and local (forest types) changes in forest cover was studied in three boreal mixed-wood forest landscapes modified by different types of disturbances: (1) a pre-industrial landscape where human settlement, agriculture, and logging activities date back to the early 1930s, (2) an industrial timber managed forest, and (3) a forest dominated by natural disturbances. Birds were sampled at 459 sampling stations distributed among the three landscapes. Local habitat and landscape characteristics of the context surrounding each sampling station (500-m and 1-km radius) were also computed. Bird communities were influenced by landscape-scale changes in forest cover. The higher proportion of early-successional habitats in both human-disturbed land-scapes resulted in significantly higher abundance of early-successional bird species and generalists. The mean number of mature forest bird species was significantly lower in the industrial and pre-industrial landscapes than in the natural landscape. Landscape-scale con-version of mature forests from mixed-wood to deciduous cover in human-disturbed land-scapes was the main cause of changes in mature forest bird communities. In these landscapes, the abundance of species associated with mixed and coniferous forest cover was lower, whereas species that preferred a deciduous cover were more abundant. Variation in bird community composition determined by the landscape context was as important as local habitat conditions, suggesting that predictions on the regional impact of forest management on songbirds with models solely based on local scale factors could be misleading. Patterns of bird species composition were related to several landscape composition variables (pro-portions of forest types), but not to configuration variables (e.g., interior habitat, amount of edge). Overall, our results indicated that the large-scale conversion of the southern portion of the boreal forest from a mixed to a deciduous cover may be one of the most important threats to the integrity of bird communities in these forest mosaics. Negative effects of changes in bird communities could be attenuated if current forestry practices are modified toward maintaining forest types (deciduous, mixed-wood, and coniferous) at levels similar to those observed under natural disturbances.},

Less intense, small-scale retention harvest systems such as single tree and group selection harvest are rarely used. In addition, natural regeneration dynamics without enrichment planting have barely been studied. Consequently, this study examined natural regeneration establishment in a multi-layered Pinus sylvestris-Picea abies forest stand in southwest Sweden after target diameter harvesting and soil scarification. The creation of forest canopy gaps had a positive effect on total seedling density five years after harvest, mainly due to a significantly higher number of Betula pendula individuals. Seedling density of more desirable tree species suitable for continuous cover forestry such as Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea and Picea abies also increased substantially in gaps when compared to pre-harvest conditions or the unharvested plots. In contrast, soil scarification did not increase the number of seedlings of desired tree species due to a significant decrease in Picea abies abundance. Soil moisture and gap size significantly improved Betula pendula seedling establishment while a larger number of Quercus petraea seedlings were observed in Vaccinium myrtillus patches. We conclude that canopy gaps are beneficial under the encountered stand conditions to initiate forest regeneration, and that soil scarification without the timely occurrence of a mast year of desired tree species is not effective in the type of forest studied.},

Such knowledge will lead to improvements in Earth system models, enabling more accurate prediction of future changes and development of informed adaptation and mitigation strategies. In this article, we review the strengths and limitations of current space-based observational capabilities for several important ABZ components and make recommendations for improving upon these current capabilities. We recommend an interdisciplinary and stepwise approach to develop a comprehensive ABZ Observing Network (ABZ-ON), beginning with an initial focus on observing networks designed to gain process-based understanding for individual ABZ components and systems that can then serve as the building blocks for a comprehensive ABZ-ON.},

Here, we quantified forest structure by calculating the effective number of layers (ENL) for different Hill Numbers (0D, 1D, 2D) as a measure of vertical structure of a subplot. We than use sampling techniques to cover the horizontal structural variability within study plots. ENL describes the vertical structure based on the occupation of 1 m wide vertical lay-ers by tree components relative to the total space occupation of a stand. Space occupation was quantified by a voxel-model obtained from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) on 150 forest plots in Germany. We used a single scan approach, which requires less field work and post-processing compared to multiple-scans. Single-scan derived mean ENL and its coefficient of variation successfully differentiated forest structures over a wide range of even-aged, uneven-aged and unmanaged broadleaved and coniferous stands. ENL was correlated to the stand summary measures basal area, quadratic mean diameter and stem density as well as stand age. ENL can be used to describe structural heterogeneity and proved to be efficiently assessable by TLS.},

A variety of habitat variables were derived from aerial photography and bathymetric and terrestrial Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data. Logistic regression against eight candidate variables, in a model selection framework, revealed considerable support for four variables with respect to explaining the presence of breeding territories.

Thus, plovers apparently select certain habitat in which to breed, involving sub-tidal, intertidal and supra-tidal habitat elements. The model also helps explain the virtual absence of breeding plovers from long sections of superficially suitable habitat, such as the fourth longest continuous beach in the world.},

This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies.},

The theoretical foundations of model selection are often poorly understood by practitioners of null hypothesis testing, and even many proponents of Chamberlin's method may not fully appreciate its historical basis. We contend that the core of Chamberlin's message, communicated over a century ago, has often been forgotten or misrepresented.

Attributes such as diet, foraging strata, foraging time, and body size, in particular, characterize a large portion of the "Eltonian" niches of species. Here we present a global species-level compilation of these key attributes for all 9993 and 5400 extant bird and mammal species derived from key literature sources. Global handbooks and monographs allowed the consistent sourcing of attributes for most species. For diet and foraging stratum we followed a defined protocol to translate the verbal descriptions into standardized, semiquantitative information about relative importance of different categories. Together with body size (continuous) and activity time (categorical) this enables a much finer distinction of species' foraging ecology than typical categorical guild assignments allow. Attributes lacking information for specific species are flagged, and interpolated values based on taxonomy are provided instead.The presented data set is limited by, among others, these select cases missing observed data, by errors and uncertainty in the expert assessment as presented in the literature, and by the lack of intraspecific information. However, the standardized and transparent nature and complete global coverage of the data set should support an array of potential studies in biogeography, community ecology, macroevolution, global change biology, and conservation. Potential uses include comparative work involving these traits as focal or secondary variables, ecological research on the trait or trophic structure of communities, or conservation science concerned with the loss of function among species or in ecosystems in a changing world.

  abstract = {Quantifying species distributions using species distribution models (SDMs) has emerged as a central method in modern biogeography. These empirical models link species occurrence data with spatial environmental information. Since their emergence in the 1990s, thousands of scientific papers have used SDMs to study organisms across the entire tree of life, with birds commanding considerable attention. Here, we review the current state of avian SDMs and point to challenges and future opportunities for specific applications, ranging from conservation biology, invasive species and predicting seabird distributions, to more general topics such as modeling avian diversity, niche evolution and seasonal distributions at a biogeographic scale. While SDMs have been criticized for being phenomenological in nature, and for their inability to explicitly account for a variety of processes affecting populations, we conclude that they remain a powerful tool to learn about past, current, and future species distributions \textendash{} at least when their limitations and assumptions are recognized and addressed. We close our review by providing an outlook on prospects and synergies with other disciplines in which avian SDMs can play an important role.},

Canopy fuel metrics such as canopy height (CH), canopy base height (CBH), canopy bulk density (CBD) and available canopy fuel (ACF) are specific inputs for wildfire behavior models such as FARSITE and emission models such as FOFEM. With finer spatial resolution data, accurate quantification of these metrics with detailed spatial heterogeneity can be accomplished. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and color near-infrared imagery are active and passive systems, respectively, that have been utilized for measuring a range of forest structure characteristics at high resolution. The objective of this research was to determine which remote sensing dataset can estimate canopy fuels more accurately and whether a fusion of these datasets produces more accurate estimates. Regression models were developed for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stand representative of eastern Washington State using field data collected in the Ahtanum State Forest and metrics derived from LiDAR and imagery. Strong relationships were found with LiDAR alone and LiDAR was found to increase canopy fuel accuracy compared to imagery. Fusing LiDAR with imagery and/or LiDAR intensity led to small increases in estimation accuracy over LiDAR alone. By improving the ability to estimate canopy fuels at higher spatial resolutions, spatially explicit fuel layers can be created and used in wildfire behavior and smoke emission models leading to more accurate estimations of crown fire risk and smoke related emissions.},

  abstract = {Habitat loss is the main driver of the current biodiversity crisis, a landscape-scale process that affects the survival of spatially-structured populations. Although it is well-established that species responses to habitat loss can be abrupt, the existence of a biodiversity threshold is still the cause of much controversy in the literature and would require that most species respond similarly to the loss of native vegetation. Here we test the existence of a biodiversity threshold, i.e. an abrupt decline in species richness, with habitat loss. We draw on a spatially-replicated dataset on Atlantic forest small mammals, consisting of 16 sampling sites divided between forests and matrix habitats in each of five 3600-ha landscapes (varying from 5\% to 45\% forest cover), and on an a priori classification of species into habitat requirement categories (forest specialists, habitat generalists and open-area specialists). Forest specialists declined abruptly below 30\% of forest cover, and spillover to the matrix occurred only in more forested landscapes. Generalists responded positively to landscape heterogeneity, peaking at intermediary levels of forest cover. Open area specialists dominated the matrix and did not spillover to forests. As a result of these distinct responses, we observed a biodiversity threshold for the small mammal community below 30\% forest cover, and a peak in species richness just above this threshold. Our results highlight that cross habitat spillover may be asymmetrical and contingent on landscape context, occurring mainly from forests to the matrix and only in more forested landscapes. Moreover, they indicate the potential for biodiversity thresholds in human-modified landscapes, and the importance of landscape heterogeneity to biodiversity. Since forest loss affected not only the conservation value of forest patches, but also the potential for biodiversity-mediated services in anthropogenic habitats, our work indicates the importance of proactive measures to avoid human-modified landscapes to cross this threshold.},

This focus can result in areas, such as heavily logged forests, being viewed as low quality and thus offered up for conversion. We assessed the importance of intact to heavily logged forests for the Bornean elephant in the Malaysian state of Sabah. By modelling distributions of elephants throughout Sabah based on GPS telemetry tracking of 29 individuals and airborne three-dimensional forest mapping, we present the most wide-scale analysis of forest use by Bomean elephants to date. Forests of 13 m in stature were found to be of highest suitability for elephants, especially when these areas were flat and low lying. Forest statures of this order are consistent with degraded landscapes, often viewed as suitable for oil palm conversion. Less than a quarter of fully-protected intact forests in Sabah were of suitable stature for elephants, whereas disturbed commercial forest reserves were found to be highly suitable. We suggest that the importance of degraded landscapes for the future of elephants is currently underestimated, and thus, the need for the preservation of such habitats is not seen as a priority. The loss of these landscapes to large-scale agriculture could prove detrimental to the longevity of the species in Borneo.},

  abstract = {ARTICLE INFO Keywords: Strategic forest management Variable retention Black vulture Ecosystem services Goal programming ABSTRACT For the past few decades, the integration of biodiversity conservation into forest management has constituted an important challenge, since the new forest management models should make conservation objectives compatible with production issues. In many countries, timber production is no longer the main ecosystem service provided, thus other aspects such as biodiversity conservation are taken into account. One of the strategies developed to do so is to define, at the stand level, areas where final cuttings are not allowed. These areas can be found dispersed or aggregated (comprised of multiple stands) throughout the forest, helping to maintain a percentage of mature forest that fulfils conservation goals. In this study, we have developed a strategic forest planning model that allows us to integrate several retention systems compared to the business-as-usual treatment traditionally used. Production, technical and environmental criteria have been considered in order to analyse the degree of conflict between them by designing a pay-off matrix. Using multicriteria techniques conflicting objectives were assessed, and decision makers' interactions have been introduced. These interactions range from criteria selection to the allocation of preferential weights to each criterion until the best solution among a set of possible alternatives is identified. The presented analytical procedure is based on the extended goal programming method applied in an exemplary forest in central Spain. Our results show that the proposed methodology allows deriving solutions that are acceptable for decision makers while estimating physical and economic opportunity costs of conservation measures in timber volume and Euros respectively.},

One hundred and seventy-nine references appearing in the ISI Web of Science database in the last 30 years have been categorized and evaluated according to different attributes like model components, forest management elements, or biodiversity issues. The results show that many OR methods have been applied to deal with this challenging objective. Thus, up to 18 OR techniques, divided into four large groups, which have been employed in four or more articles, have been identified. However, it has been observed how the evolution of these papers in time apparently tended to increase only until 2008. Finally, two clear trends in this set of papers should be highlighted: the incorporation of spatial analysis tools into these operational research models and, second, the setting up of hybrid models, which combine different techniques to solve this type of problem.},

The CGE is one of 25 global biodiversity hotspots prioritized for conservation due to its high biodiversity and endemism as well as threats due to deforestation. The analysis of land-use and land-cover (LULC) change within the CGE using remotely sensed imagery is challenging because this area is considered to be one of the rainiest places on the planet (hence high frequency of cloud cover). Furthermore, the availability of high-resolution remotely sensed data is low for developing countries before 2015. Using the Random Forest ensemble learning classification tree system, we developed annual LULC maps in the CGE from 2002 to 2015 using a time series of cloud-free MODIS vegetation index products. The MODIS imagery was processed through a Gaussian weighted filter to further correct for cloud pollution and matched to visual interpretations of land cover and land use from available high spatial resolution imagery (WorldView-2, Quick Bird, Ikonos and GeoEye-1). Validation of LULC maps resulted in a Kappa of 0.87 (Sd = 0.008). We detected a gradual replacement of forested areas with agriculture (mainly grassland planted to support livestock grazing), and secondary vegetation (agriculture reverting to forest) across the CGE. Forest loss was higher between 2010\textendash 2015 when compared to 2002\textendash 2010.

Lidar data have proven particularly useful for measuring or estimating a suite of forest structural attributes such as canopy height, basal area, and LAI. However, the potential of this technology to characterize forest succession remains largely untested. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of lidar data for characterizing forest successional stages across a structurally diverse, mixed-species forest in Northern Idaho. We used a variety of lidar-derived metrics in conjunction with an algorithmic modeling procedure (Random Forests) to classify six stages of three-dimensional forest development and achieved an overall accuracy {$>$} 95\%. The algorithmic model presented herein developed ecologically meaningful classifications based upon lidar metrics quantifying mean vegetation height and canopy cover, among others. This study highlights the utility of lidar data for accurately classifying forest succession in complex, mixed coniferous forests; but further research should be conducted to classify forest successional stages across different forests types. The techniques presented herein can be easily applied to other areas. Furthermore, the final classification map represents a significant advancement for forest succession modeling and wildlife habitat assessment. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

SDMs commonly use coarse-grain metrics, such as forest patch size or patch connectivity, over broad spatial extents. However, species distributions are likely driven in part by local, fine-grained habitat conditions. Conservation and management are often planned and applied locally, where coarse predictions may be uninformative or not sufficiently precise.We investigated the integration of high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) with avian point sampling data to develop a detection-corrected occupancy model to quantify habitat-occurrence relationships for two species with different habitats: the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) on a military installation in central Texas.We compared occupancy models that used only the more conventional, coarse remotely sensed metrics to models that also incorporated high-resolution LiDAR-derived metrics for vegetation height and canopy cover, to assess their use for predicting distributions. Models including LiDAR-derived vegetation height and canopy cover metrics were competitive for both species, and models without LiDAR-derived vegetation height had substantially lower model weights and explanatory strength. Area under curve estimates for the highest ranked models were high for warblers (0.864) and moderate for vireos (0.746). Using the best supported models for each species, we predicted the occurrence distribution for both species. The resulting predictions provide a decision support tool that enables assessment of the status, impacts, and mitigation of impacts to endangered species habitat on the installation due to land management and military training activities that is more standardized and accurate than current assessment approaches based on visual gestalt of habitat and expert opinion. Additionally, although previous species distribution models have been created for our focal species, most fail to match the grain and extent of most management actions or include local, fine-grained metrics that influence distributions. In contrast, we demonstrate that use of LiDAR with species occurrence data can provide precision and resolution at a scale that is relevant ecologically and to the operational scale of most conservation and management actions.

  abstract = {Dead wood such as stumps and logs found on the forest floor is a key structural element that is used by a broad spectrum of organisms and contributes to soil nutrient cycling. The complexity of the forest floor in the boreal forest is largely dependent on coarse woody debris (CWD), but actual forestry practices may compromise the future recruitment of this resource. The main goal of our study was to determine the effects of CWD on small mammals in stands of varying green-tree retention levels. Since small mammals are associated with microhabitat components at multiple spatial scales, our secondary goal was to assess the effects of scale on small mammal relationship with CWD. Five trapping sessions were conducted in the boreal forest of western Quebec, Canada during the summers of 2009 and 2010 in four managed forest blocks. Each block was composed of 12 independent trapping grids equally distributed in three treatments: clearcuts (0\% green-tree retention), partial cuts (30\% green-tree retention) and controls (undisturbed). We live-trapped small rodents and used pitfall traps for shrews in trapping sub-grids (fine-scale; 50 m) nested in larger grids (stand-scale; 300 m). Southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) abundances were positively associated with sites with high volumes of well decayed CWD in all treatments, at the fine-scale. Southern bog lemming (Synaptomys cooperi) abundance was positively associated with well decayed CWD, at both scales, but mainly in clearcut areas. Masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) abundance increased with high volumes of well decayed CWD in clearcuts but only at the stand-scale. In contrast, meadow voles were more abundant in sites with high volumes of well decayed CWD in controls than in sites with small volumes at the stand-scale. Patches of partial cuts with high volumes of well decayed CWD were characterized by high abundances of red-backed voles and this clearly indicates that volume and decay of CWD are important drivers that can mitigate the impacts of tree removal. We found different scale-dependent responses of small mammals to volumes of well decayed CWD, which indicates that associations were found at the individual as well as at the population level. We suggest that partial cuts composed of regularly distributed patches of high volumes of CWD ({$>$}= 11.4 m(3) in patches of 0.03 ha) might have a high potential to maintain red-backed voles, a species associated with mature forests.

Retention of trees at harvest was introduced about 25 years ago to mitigate negative impacts on biodiversity, mainly from clearcutting, and is now widely practiced in boreal and temperate regions. Despite numerous studies on response of flora and fauna to retention, no comprehensive review has summarized its effects on biodiversity in comparison to clearcuts as well as un-harvested forests. 2. Using a systematic review protocol, we completed a meta-analysis of 78 studies including 944 comparisons of biodiversity between retention cuts and either clearcuts or un-harvested forests, with the main objective of assessing whether retention forestry helps, at least in the short term, to moderate the negative effects of clearcutting on flora and fauna. 3. Retention cuts supported higher richness and a greater abundance of forest species than clearcuts as well as higher richness and abundance of open-habitat species than un-harvested forests. For all species taken together (i.e. forest species, open-habitat species, generalist spe-cies and unclassified species), richness was higher in retention cuts than in clearcuts. 4. Retention cuts had negative impacts on some species compared to un-harvested forest, indicating that certain forest-interior species may not survive in retention cuts. Similarly, retention cuts were less suitable for some open-habitat species compared with clearcuts. 5. Positive effects of retention cuts on richness of forest species increased with proportion of retained trees and time since harvest, but there were not enough data to analyse possible threshold effects, that is, levels at which effects on biodiversity diminish. Spatial arrangement of the trees (aggregated vs. dispersed) had no effect on either forest species or open-habitat species, although lim-ited data may have hindered our capacity to identify responses. Results for different comparisons were largely consistent among taxonomic groups for forest and open-habitat species, respectively. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analysis provides support for wider use of retention forestry since it moderates negative harvesting impacts on biodiversity. Hence, it is a promising},

  abstract = {In eastern Canada, boreal forests develop structural diversity in association with time since stand replacing fire. In some regions, this is associated with significant changes in the bryophyte community (Sphagnum moss invasion) and paludification (thick waterlogged forest floor development). The bryophyte community responds to opening of the canopy, and increasing moisture by replacement of slow growing species by faster growing Sphagnum spp. (e.g. magellanicum, fallax) that are dependent on constant hydration. Within a forest management context, partial harvest systems have been proposed As a strategy to maintain structural diversity, which is currently not accomplished with low retention systems. However, it is unknown whether these interventions will effectively accelerate community succession. The questions addressed in this study were: (1) is the composition of Sphagnum colonies in partially cut stands more similar to old-growth communities than in control, and low retention cut stands, (2) what aspects of harvest disturbance drive these changes, and (3) is the growth rate of Sphagnum capillifolium (an early successional shade tolerant species) different in partial versus low retention harvest systems? After harvest, Sphagnum patch size was reduced by 19.8\% and 11.7\% after low retention and partial harvest, respectively. While trends were not constant across three separate partial cut trials, the proportion of Sphagnum magellanicum, Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum fiscum increased compared to controls and low retention 1-2 years after harvest. Models of percent Sphagnum cover indicated machinery track cover, percent cover of vascular plants, and patch depth were positive factors, while the influence of open canopy varied among species. Despite the inclusion of individual disturbance variables, the summary variable `treatment' was significant in all models. Growth of S. capillifolium in partial cuts was intermediate to growth rates in control and low-retention cuts. Growth was positively influenced by slash cover and, contrary to the patch level, negatively influenced by track cover. These results indicate that partial harvest does represent an intermediate level of disturbance, as direct and indirect harvest effects were reduced, as was Sphagnum death. Change in composition I and 2 years after harvest indicates that partial harvests may effectively shift the bryophyte community towards an older community type and may thus be used to create landscape diversity. Long term trends and entire community compositions need to be assessed before this can be stated definitively. However, as paludified stands are less productive, the capacity of these partially harvested sites to produce merchantable timber is questioned. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using the AUC to compare model performance, the Random Forest produced the most accurate distribution model, followed by MaxEnt, and Support Vector Machine (0.98, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively). We interpreted, from Boosted Regression Tree analysis, that elevation is the single most influential factor in determining migrant occupancy, with vegetative biomass the least influential predictor. Our approach here allows conservation biologists a more sophisticated approach to identifying critical areas for migratory passerines across large spatial extents in a short amount of time.},

  abstract = {Background: So far, studies of avian space use are mostly realized in 2D, with the vertical dimension ignored. We propose here a new, relatively simple and computationally reasonable method for the estimation of volumetric (i.e. 3D) avian home ranges. Methods: Through accurate GPS data-loggers, we collected 25,405 GPS points on Lesser Kestrels' (Falco naumanni) space use during the nestling period in one main colony in Italy. We applied our 3D home range estimator to the whole GPS dataset, and also separately to diurnal and nocturnal GPS points. Results: The 3D colony home range resulted equal to 28.12 km(3). By considering daytime and night-time separately, the volumetric home ranges resulted considerably different. Conclusions: Our 3D home range estimator, because of its intuitive and straightforward properties, can easily capitalize on the datasets offered by modern biotelemetry (data-loggers, light detection and LIDAR sensors) and enhance conservation strategies for mitigating anthropogenic impacts on bird species. Its applications embrace, but are not limited to, more accurate estimates of collision risk with power lines, aircrafts and wind farms, and increased knowledge of birds' space requirements in order to persist in their distribution areas.},

Determining causation is far more valuable than simply indicating how the response variable and explanatory variables covaried within a data set, especially when the data set did not arise from a controlled experiment.

To appropriately analyze these data, hierarchical models have been developed to separately model explanatory variables of both a latent abundance or occurrence process and a conditional detection process. Because these models have a straightforward interpretation paralleling mechanisms under which the data arose, they have recently gained immense popularity. The common hierarchical structure of these models is well-suited for a unified modeling interface.

  abstract = {There are immense differences between even-aged silvicultural disturbances (especially clearcutting) and natural disturbances, such as windthrow, wildfire, and even volcanic eruptions. On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens in the Cascade Range of Washington State erupted cataclysmically. This was a monumental disturbance event, the likes of which had not been seen since western settlement of the region. The eruption began with a massive (2.8 square km) landslide that decapitated the mountain exposing its superheated core. The ensuing explosion created a 50,000 hectare " blast zone " . Superheated pyroclastic flows and numerous debris flows or lahars swept down the slopes and valleys. To the north and east of the mountain, volcanic ejecta fell over thousands of square kilometers. The scale, intensity, and synergy of these disturbances created a rich laboratory for the study of disturbance ecology (1,2). Scientists expected to encounter a moonscape within the blast zone, a prediction encouraged by early television images of a uniformly gray landscape. According to traditional ecological theory, recovery would be slow: the sterilized landscape would be repopulated gradually by pioneering organisms dispersing into the blasted region. The pioneers would eventually mitigate conditions sufficiently to allow for establishment of species characteristic of later successional stages. The reality of ecological recovery at Mount St. Helens was very different from these predictions (1,2). Surviving organisms were present almost everywhere in incredibly varied forms and circumstances\textemdash e.g., as complete animals and plants, perennating plant parts, and seed and spore banks protected within the soil and snowbanks. Included were species identified with all successional states\textemdash pioneer to climax\textemdash and of all life forms and trophic levels. Not all initial survivors persisted, of course, but many did. The diversity and abundance of survivors was notably dependent upon the site-specific combination of disturbances.},

The DEMO experiment arose in response to this need, with leadership provided by a consortium of university and Forest Service scientists and federal forest managers. With specific congressional direction (included in federal appropriations for the Forest Service), the initial planning for an experiment in retention harvest strategies began in 1992. Initial planning efforts were hampered by competing research objectives and disagreements over experimental design, shifts in program leadership, difficulties in transferring funds to the appropriate entities, and conflicts related to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. In 1994, once these challenges were overcome, the experiment began. DEMO is not only an experiment in retention harvesting, but also in collaboration between research and management, as well as federal and state governments and the university community. The scope and intensity of collaboration have been demanding, requiring effective communication and coordination across institutional lines. The early history of DEMO has taught us that experiments of this kind require: (1) a coordinated legislative package and multi-year budget commitment, (2) a well-developed management structure, (3) an efficient process for planning, (4) commitment of lead scientists to the coordination and planning of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research activities, (5) effective collaboration between research and management, and (6) a well-developed outreach program. Other large-scale silvicultural/ecological experiments with characteristics similar to DEMO are underway at several locations around the world. These will offer additional learning opportunities for large-scale, interdisciplinary research.},

Creation of openings, even those based on disturbance processes, has been especially difficult.

On Moist Forest sites (MF), the strategy calls for reserving older forest stands, thinning plantations to accelerate development of structural complexity, and implementing variable retention harvests in younger forests to help provide diverse early seral ecosystems. On Dry Forest (DF) sites, the strategy calls for silvicultural treatments that retain and release older trees, reduce stand densities, shift composition toward fire- and drought-tolerant tree species, and incorporate spatial heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. Immediate goals of this restoration framework include increased ecological integrity and resilience in DFs, increased diversity and complexity of successional stages in MFs, and provision of wood products to local communities. Over the long run, we believe this program can provide an acceptable pathway to sustained yield on federal forestlands in the Pacific Northwest.},

Forest fire burn severity is often measured at a plot scale using the Composite Burn Index (CBI), which was originally developed as a means of assigning severity levels to the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) computed from Landsat satellite imagery. Our study investigated the potential to map biophysical indicators of burn severity (residual green vegetation and charred organic surface) at very high (3 cm) resolution, using color orthomosaics and vegetation height models derived from UAV-based photographic surveys and Structure from Motion methods. These indicators were scaled to 30 m resolution Landsat pixel footprints and compared to the post-burn NBR (post-NBR) and differenced NBR (dNBR) ratios computed from pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery. The post-NBR showed the strongest relationship to both the fraction of charred surface (exponential R2 = 0.79) and the fraction of green crown vegetation above 5 m (exponential R2 = 0.81), while the dNBR was more closely related to the total green vegetation fraction (exponential R2 = 0.69). Additionally, the UAV green fraction and Landsat indices could individually explain more than 50\% of the variance in the overall CBI measured in 39 plots. These results provide a proof-of-concept for using low-cost UAV photogrammetric mapping to quantify key measures of boreal burn severity at landscape scales, which could be used to calibrate and assign a biophysical meaning to Landsat spectral indices for mapping severity at regional scales.},

  abstract = {1. Habitat loss and modification are hallmarks of anthropogenic ecosystems, but the consequences for ecosystem functioning and service provisioning often remain unclear. Understanding these links in cities is complicated by strong but fine-scale differences in habitat structure among green space patches, and a high variance in habitat amount across urban landscapes. 2. We used airborne laser scanning data to disentangle the effects of 3D woody habitat heterogeneity of urban home gardens, and woody habitat amount at four landscape spatial scales (50, 100, 250, and 500 m), on the predation risk of artificial sentinel prey by birds and arthropods. 3. In both predator groups, and at all the investigated spatial scales, cross-scale interactive effects between garden habitat heterogeneity and habitat amount in the urban landscape were the main drivers of predation. Risk of predation by birds was highest in heterogeneous garden habitats, but only in densely built urban landscapes where habitat amount was low to intermediate (10\%-20\%) at large spatial scales (250-500 m). It dropped independently of garden habitat heterogeneity when habitat amount became too low ({$<$}10\%) at small (50-100 m) spatial scales. In contrast, risk of predation by arthropods mostly peaked in homogeneous garden habitats when habitat amount was intermediate (20\%) at large spatial scales. 4. Our findings show that the ability of urban green space patches, such as gardens, to sustain ecosystem functions in cities mainly depends on cross-scale interactive effects with larger scale habitat amount. In birds, predation activity can increase when high patch-scale habitat heterogeneity contrasts with reduced larger scale habitat amount, suggesting concentration effects. Yet, thresholds exist under which ecosystem functioning drops independently of habitat structure. 5. Synthesis and applications. The potential of small-scale interventions to enhance habitat heterogeneity (e.g., by planting native trees with understorey shrubs) for restoring ecosystem functions, such as bird predation, in urban areas is dependent on wider landscape habitat structure. Urban planning should therefore adopt a multiscale approach to sustain and restore ecosystem functions and services; a simple but still not broadly recognized finding. Airborne laser scanning is a useful tool to infer habitat structure across a hierarchy of scales in spatially heterogeneous anthropogenic ecosystems.},

In this research, we explored the potential of small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to derive a comprehensive set of habitat predictors to explain distribution variance of an alpine bird community in Jikdril county, on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In 2014 and 2015, we carried out two breeding season bird surveys on 140 plots, from eight sample blocks in the Nyanpo Yutse region. In summer 2014, we conducted 39 flights over the eight sample blocks, and obtained 5500 images which covered 45 km 2 of alpine grassland habitat. We used photogrammetry software to generate high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models with an average pixel size of 13 cm. We derived both 3D-and 2D-UAV-based models as habitat predictors used to analyze explained variance in the local bird community at four different sample scales (plot radii of 50 m, 100 m, 150 m and 200 m). We performed canonical correspondence analyses (CCA), with a model-building approach based on permutation. Furthermore, the proportion of total variance explained by each predictor group was calculated, and analysis of results showed that UAV data derived predictors played a significant role in explaining the variance of the sampled bird community on the QTP. In particular, 3D-based predictors contributed strongly to the explanation of variance (50 m: 45.44\%, 100 m: 44.60\%, 150 m: 49.21\%, 200 m: 36.22\% of the total explained variance per sample size), followed by 2D-based predictors over the same four sample scales (50 m: 35.45\%, 100 m: 34.57\%, 150 m: 31.19\%, 200 m: 39.48\%). Our results indicate that a sample plot scale of 150-200 m radius leads to the most comprehensive explanation of variance (all predictors: 39.59\%, P {$<$} 0.0001 and 39.13\% P {$<$} 0.0001).

Small remotely piloted aircraft systems (sRPAS, a.k.a. drones) have the potential to decrease the cost of field surveys drastically, but produce large quantities of data that will require specialized processing techniques. In this study, we explored the possibility of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on this data for automatically detecting conifer seedlings along recovering seismic lines: a common legacy footprint from oil and gas exploration. We assessed three different CNN architectures, of which faster region-CNN (R-CNN) performed best (mean average precision 81\%). Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of training-set size, season, seedling size, and spatial resolution on the detection performance. Our results indicate that drone imagery analyzed by artificial intelligence can be used to detect conifer seedlings in regenerating sites with high accuracy, which increases with the size in pixels of the seedlings. By using a pre-trained network, the size of the training dataset can be reduced to a couple hundred seedlings without any significant loss of accuracy. Furthermore, we show that combining data from different seasons yields the best results. The proposed method is a first step towards automated monitoring of forest restoration/regeneration.},

  abstract = {Background: Conceptual clarity is important to attain precise communication of scientific knowledge and to implement appropriate technological and policy actions. Many concepts referring to forest management are widely used by decision-makers, regardless of their complexity. Although the scientific and methodological issues of forestry practices are frequently discussed in the literature, their normative dimensions are rarely treated. Thus, linguistic uncertainty increases when different environmentally ethical perspectives and ways of valuing forests are considered. The objective was to compare different conceptualizations on the silvicultural systems suggested for forest management and the implications they have for conservation. We have conceptually contrasted high-intensity forestry practices with variable retention harvesting, considering different environmentally ethical perspectives and forest valuation alternatives. Results: Clear boundaries between clear-cutting, selective logging, and variable retention harvesting can be evidenced when different ethical points of view and alternatives in the human-nature relationships are considered. We have found a variety of definitions of variable retention harvesting that can be analyzed under different ethical positions. Sharply contrasting views on variable retention harvesting can be evidenced if nature is considered to be purely at human's service or if it is conceptualized as humans co-inhabiting with nature. The latter position implies that the maintenance of ecological, evolutionary, and historical processes supported by unmanaged forest stands is a crucial step for forest management proposals based on variable retention harvesting. Conclusions: Forestry practices that are focused on forest yields and that misinterpret functional uncertainty of forest functioning would be risky. Moreover, forestry with variable retention harvesting could imply good yields with reasonable conservation management in some contexts, while it could be unacceptable in other socio-ecological contexts. The improvement of conceptual clarity on the different meanings of variable retention harvesting and the development of indicators for forest management based on the variations of this concept can reduce controversies.},

Fuels treatments, landscape-scale modifications of forest fuels and structure, are likely to remain a management tool to modify fire behavior and restore ecological resilience. The impacts of fuels treatments to listed species such as spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) remain uncertain and are contested because of limited available information. To evaluate spotted owl foraging habitat selection in a landscape recently modified by forest fuels-reduction treatments, we radio-marked and tracked 10 California spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) for 2 years immediately following fuels treatment installation in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We categorized fuels treatments into 3 types: mechanical thin, installed within the study area as landscape-scale fire breaks characterized by even tree spacing, open understory, and low canopy cover, or group selections; understory thin, a hand-removal of small trees and shrubs; and understory thin followed by underburn, a controlled surface-fuel burn that left the overstory intact. We described post-treatment habitat using forest structural metrics derived from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset that was collected 1 year after fuels treatments were completed. We collected 436 spotted owl foraging locations during 2 breeding seasons and evaluated breeding season home range size and composition using a resource selection function. We assessed possible contributors to owl foraging patterns by comparing a priori hypotheses in an information-theoretic approach and using randomly generated points that estimated available habitat. Spotted owl breeding season home ranges contained fuels treatments in proportion to their availability on the landscape and averaged 17.1\% treated area. Within the home range, owl foraging locations in the post-treatment landscape were best predicted by lower proportions of gaps than anticipated at random, steeper slopes, and minimized distance from the owl's site center. Our results suggest that moderate to high proportions of gaps, typically a feature of forest fuels reduction and restoration treatments, may reduce the probability of spotted owl foraging.

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Biodiversity conservation is a key objective for sustainable forest management, but the multi-dimen-sional and multi-scale character of biodiversity renders full assessment difficult at large scale. Therefore, indicators are often used to monitor biodiversity. Important cost-benefit synergies can be achieved if indicators are derived from existing data. In this study, a model for classifying forest stand structures was developed and tested as an indicator of overall plant species diversity at stand level. The model com-bines four stand structure parameters: canopy coverage, age of canopy trees, tree species composition and canopy stratification. Using data from the National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden and General Linear Mixed Model, plant species diversity (Shannon diversity index, SHDI) and composition (S\o rensen-Dice index, SDI) were tested between 26 different stand structure types and nine soil classes. The results showed that mature stands with a stratified canopy had the highest plant species diversity across the soil classes, particularly if they comprised mixed coniferous and broadleaved species with a semi-open can-opy. In contrast, young ({$<$}30 years) single-layered stands had consistently low species diversity. Of the four stand structure parameters in the model, age of canopy trees was most influential for SHDI value, followed by canopy stratification, tree species composition and canopy coverage. According to the SDI values, different stand structure types represented different species composition regardless of soil class and species diversity (SHDI value). However, most SDI values were higher than 0.5, indicating that fewer than 50\% of the species changed between stand structure types. The stand parameters included in the model can probably be extracted from national forest inventories in many countries and understood without specialist taxonomic knowledge, making the model applicable in practice to support forest man-agement decision-making on enhancing forest biodiversity at stand level.},

  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 {$\mu$}m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 {$\mu$}m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as ({$\varrho$}(0.86 {$\mu$}m) - {$\varrho$}(1.24 {$\mu$}m))({$\varrho$}(0.86 {$\mu$}m) + {$\varrho$}(1.24 {$\mu$}m)), where {$\varrho$} represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-{$\mu$}m and the 1.24-{$\mu$}m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 {$\mu$}m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 {$\mu$}m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86\textendash 1.24 {$\mu$}m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-{$\mu$}m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 {$\mu$}m, NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

New tools for collection of data on forest bird response to fine-grained forest structure provide opportunities to evaluate habitat thresholds for forest birds. We used LiDAR-derived estimates of habitat attributes and resource selection to evaluate foraging habitat thresholds for recovery of the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis; RCW) on the Savannah River Site, South Carolina. First, we generated utilization distributions to define habitat use and availability for 30 RCW groups surveyed over a {$>$}4-h period twice per month between April 2013 and March 2015. Next, we used piecewise regression to characterize RCW threshold responses to LiDAR-derived habitat attributes described in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service recovery plan for RCW. Finally, we used resource utilization functions to estimate selection of specific habitat thresh-olds and used the magnitude of selection to prioritize thresholds for conservation. We identified lower and upper thresholds for densities of pines !35.6 cm dbh (22, 65 trees/ha), basal area (BA) of pines !25.4 cm dbh (1.4, 2.2 m 2 /ha), hardwood canopy cover (6, 31\%), and BA of hardwoods 7.6\textendash 22.9 cm dbh (0.4, 6.07 m 2 /ha); we identified three thresholds for density of pines 7.6\textendash 25.4 cm dbh (56, 341, and 401 trees/ha). Selection rankings prioritized foraging habitat with {$<$}6\% hardwood canopy cover (b = 0.254, 95\% CI = 0.172\textendash 0.336), {$<$} 1.2 m 2 /ha BA of hardwoods 7.6\textendash 22.9 cm dbh (b = 0.162, 95\% CI = 0.050\textendash 0.275), !1.4 m 2 /ha BA of pines !25.4 cm dbh (b = 0.055, 95\% CI = 0.022\textendash 0.087), and !22 pines !35.6 cm dbh/ha (b = 0.015, 95\% CI = 0.013\textendash 0.042). We identified habitat thresholds corresponding to open canopy structure, moderate densities of large and medium pines, and sparse hardwood midstory trees. Selection ranks prioritized multiple thresholds below USFWS range-wide recovery thresholds, indicating site-specific management goals may be beneficial for RCW conservation. Fine-grained LiDAR-derived habitat data coupled with GPS-derived habitat use can guide forest bird conservation by identifying the full range of structural conditions associated with threshold responses.},

We integrated fine-grained LiDAR-derived habitat data, spatial distribution of cavity trees, and spatially explicit behavioral observations in a multi-scale model to determine the relative importance of conspecific density, intraspecific interactions, and the distribution of cavities on space use by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) on 2 sites in South Carolina, USA. We evaluated candidate models using information theoretic methods. Top scale-specific models included effects of conspecific density and number of cavity tree starts within 200 m of Red-cockaded Woodpecker foraging locations, and effects of the number of intraspecific interactions within 400 m of Red-cockaded Woodpecker foraging locations. The top multi-scale model for 22 of 34 Red-cockaded Woodpecker groups included covariates for the number of groups within 200 m of foraging locations and LiDAR-derived habitat with moderate densities of large pines (Pinus spp.) and minimal hardwood overstory. These results indicate distribution of neighboring groups was the most important predictor of space use once a minimal set of structural habitat thresholds was reached, and that placing recruitment clusters as little as 400 m from foraging partitions of neighboring groups may promote establishment of new breeding groups in unoccupied habitat. The presence of neighboring groups likely provides cues to foraging Red-cockaded Woodpeckers that facilitate prospecting prior to juvenile dispersal and, to a lesser extent, indicates high-quality forage resources. Careful consideration of local distribution of neighboring groups in potential habitat may improve managers' ability to increase Red-cockaded Woodpecker density on restored landscapes and mitigate isolation of Red-cockaded Woodpecker groups, a problem that negatively affects fitness across the species' range.},

As high-resolution data are usually expensive, an assessment of their contribution to the reliability of habitat models is of interest for both researchers and managers. We evaluated how vegetation cover datasets of different spatial resolutions influence the inferences and predictive power of multi-scale habitat selection models for the endangered brown bear populations in the Cantabrian Range (NW Spain). We quantified the relative performance of three types of datasets: (i) coarse resolution data from Corine Land Cover (minimum mapping unit of 25 ha), (ii) medium resolution data from the Forest Map of Spain (minimum mapping unit of 2.25 ha and information on forest canopy cover and tree species present in each polygon), and (iii) high-resolution Lidar data (about 0.5 points/m 2) providing a much finer information on forest canopy cover and height. Despite all the models performed well (AUC {$>$} 0.80), the predictive ability of multi-scale models significantly increased with spatial resolution, particularly when other predictors of habitat suitability (e.g. human pressure) were not used to indirectly filter out areas with a more degraded vegetation cover. The addition of fine grain information on forest structure (LiDAR) led to a better under-standing of landscape use and a more accurate spatial representation of habitat suitability, even for a species with large spatial requirements as the brown bear, which will result in the development of more effective measures to assist endangered species conservation.},

However, land-use change leading to environmental homogenization is a major cause for the dramatic decline of biodiversity under global change. The difficulty in assessing large-scale biodiversity losses urgently requires new technological advances to evaluate land-use impact on diversity timely and efficiently across space. 2. While cost-effective aerial images have been suggested for potential biodiversity assessments in forests, correlation of canopy object variables such as gaps with plant or animal diversity has so far not been demonstrated using these images. 3. Here, we show that aerial images of canopy gaps can be used to assess floristic biodiversity of the forest understorey. This approach is made possible because we employed cutting-edge unmanned aerial vehicles and very high-resolution images (7 cm pixel) 1) of the canopy properties. We demonstrate that detailed, spatially implicit information on gap shape metrics is sufficient to reveal strong dependency between disturbance patterns and plant diversity (R 2 up to 0 74). This is feasible because opposing disturbance patterns such as aggregated and dispersed tree retention directly correspond to different functional and dispersal traits of species and ultimately to different species diversities. 4. Our findings can be used as a coarse-filter approach to conservation in forests wherever light strongly limits regeneration and biodiversity.},

Existing studies of species distribution patterns using hyperspectral remote sensing have used different techniques to discriminate different species, in which the wavelet transforms, derivative analysis and red edge positions are the most important of them. The wavelet transform is used based on its effectiveness and determined as the most powerful technique to identify species. Furthermore, estimations of relationships between spectral values and species distributions using chemical composition of foliage, tree phenology, selection of signature training sites based on field measured canopy composition, selection of the best wavelet coefficient and waveband regions may be useful to identify different plant species. This paper presents a summary on the feasibility, operational applications and possible strategies of hyperspectral remote sensing in forestry, especially in assessing its biodiversity.

  abstract = {Habitat suitability models (HSMs) are widely used to plan actions for species of conservation interest. Models that will be turned into conservation actions need predictors that are both ecologically pertinent and fit managers' conceptual view of ecosystems. Remote sensing technologies such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can describe landscapes at high resolution over large spatial areas and have already given promising results for modeling forest species distributions. The point-cloud (PC) area-based LiDAR variables are often used as environmental variables in HSMs and have more recently been complemented by object-oriented (OO) metrics. However, the efficiency of each type of variable to capture structural information on forest bird habitat has not yet been compared. We tested two hypotheses: (1) the use of OO variables in HSMs will give similar performance as PC area-based models; and (2) OO variables will improve model robustness to LiDAR datasets acquired at different times for the same area. Using the case of a locally endangered forest bird, the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), model performance and predictions were compared between the two variable types. Models using OO variables showed slightly lower discriminatory performance than PC area-based models (average {$\Delta$}AUC~=~-0.032 and -0.01 for females and males, respectively). OO-based models were as robust (absolute difference in Spearman rank correlation of predictions~{$\leq~$}0.21) or more robust than PC area-based models. In sum, LiDAR-derived PC area-based metrics and OO metrics showed similar performance for modeling the distribution of the capercaillie. We encourage the further exploration of OO metrics for creating reliable HSMs, and in particular testing whether they might help improve the scientist\textendash stakeholder interface through better interpretability.},

  abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity has long been recognized as a fundamental variable indicative of species diversity, in terms of both richness and abundance. Satellite remote sensing data sets can be useful for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Past remote sensing analyses of species diversity have largely been limited to correlative studies based on the use of vegetation indices or derived land cover maps. A relatively new form of laser remote sensing (lidar) provides another means to acquire information on habitat heterogeneity. Here we examine the efficacy of lidar metrics of canopy structural diversity as predictors of bird species richness in the temperate forests of Maryland, USA. Canopy height, topography and the vertical distribution of canopy elements were derived from lidar imagery of the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and compared to bird survey data collected at referenced grid locations. The canopy vertical distribution information was consistently found to be the strongest predictor of species richness, and this was predicted best when stratified into guilds dominated by forest, scrub, suburban and wetland species. Similar lidar variables were selected as primary predictors across guilds. Generalized linear and additive models, as well as binary hierarchical regression trees produced similar results. The lidar metrics were also consistently better predictors than traditional remotely sensed variables such as canopy cover, indicating that lidar provides a valuable resource for biodiversity research applications. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and ecological modeling warrant a timely and robust investigation of the ecological variables that underlie large-scale patterns of breeding bird species richness, particularly in the context of intensifying land use and climate change. Our objective was to address this need using an array of bioclimatic and remotely sensed data sets representing vegetation properties and structure, and other aspects of the physical environment. We first build models of bird species richness across breeding bird survey (BBS) routes, and then spatially predict richness across the coterminous US at moderately high spatial resolution (1 km). Predictor variables were derived from various sources and maps of species richness were generated for four groups (guilds) of birds with different breeding habitat affiliation (forest, grassland, open woodland, scrub/shrub), as well as all guilds combined. Predictions of forest bird distributions were strong (R-2 = 0.85), followed by grassland (0.76), scrub/shrub (0.63) and open woodland (0.60) species. Vegetation properties were generally the strongest determinants of species richness, whereas bioclimatic and lidar-derived vertical structure metrics were of variable importance and dependent upon the guild type. Environmental variables (climate and the physical environment) were also frequently selected predictors, but canopy structure variables were not as important as expected based on more local to regional scale studies. Relatively sparse sampling of canopy structure metrics from the satellite lidar sensor may have reduced their importance relative to other predictor variables across the study domain. We discuss these results in the context of the ecological drivers of species richness patterns, the spatial scale of bird diversity analyses, and the potential of next generation space-borne lidar systems relevant to vegetation and ecosystem studies. This study strengthens current understanding of bird species-climate-vegetation relationships, which could be further advanced with improved canopy structure information across spatial scales.},

  abstract = {The identification and analysis of ecological guilds have been fundamental to understand the processes that determine the structure and organization of communities. However, reviewing studies that have tried to categorize species into trophic guilds we found many different criteria on which such categorizations are based; consequently, a single species may have several guild designations, limiting its accuracy and applicability. In this paper we propose a classification scheme for trophic guilds as a first step to establish a common terminology. For this purpose we considered 1502 species of mainland birds and mammals from North America (Mexico, USA, and Canada). This classification takes into account 3 main criteria to identify each guild: main food type, foraging substrate and activity period. To determine the trophic guilds and assign species to them, we performed a cluster analysis to classify species according to their similarities in feeding patterns. The resulting hierarchical classification distinguishes 6 main levels of organization, which may occur in different combinations among taxonomic groups and sites: 1) taxon (e. g., birds or mammal), 2) diet (e. g. granivore, insectivore), 3) foraging habitat (e. g., terrestrial, arboreal), 4) substrate used for foraging (e. g., ground, foliage), 5) foraging behavior (e. g., gleaner, hunter), and 6) activity period (e. g., nocturnal, diurnal). We identified 22 guilds for birds and 27 for mammals. This approach aims to group together species that use similar resources in a similar way, and extend the usefulness of this approach to studies intend to analyze the organization of biotic communities. La identificaci\'on y el an\'alisis de gremios ecol\'ogicos han sido fundamentales para entender los procesos que determinan la estructura y organizaci\'on de las comunidades. Sin embargo, revisando los estudios que han clasificado las especies en gremios, encontramos que tales clasificaciones est\'an basadas en diferentes criterios; como consecuencia, una especie puede tener varias designaciones gremiales, limitando su precisi\'on y aplicabilidad. En este trabajo proponemos un esquema de clasificaci\'on en gremios tr\'oficos como primer paso para establecer una terminolog\'ia com\'un. Para ello, se consideraron 1 502 especies de aves y mam\'iferos distribuidos en Am\'erica del Norte (M\'exico, EUA y Canad\'a). Esta clasificaci\'on tiene en cuenta 3 criterios: la dieta principal, el sustrato de forrajeo y el per\'iodo de actividad. Para determinar los gremios tr\'oficos se realiz\'o un an\'alisis de conglomerados que nos permiti\'o clasificar las especies en funci\'on de similitudes y diferencias en sus patrones de alimentaci\'on. Esta clasificaci\'on es jer\'arquica y distingue 6 principales niveles de organizaci\'on que pueden presentarse en diversas combinaciones entre grupos taxon\'omicos y lugares: 1) taxon (e. g., aves, mam\'iferos); 2) dieta (e. g., gran\'ivoro, insect\'ivoro); 3) h\'abitat de forrajeo (e. g., terrestre, arb\'oreo); 4) sustrato donde obtiene su alimento (e. g., suelo, follaje); 5) t\'ecnica de forrajeo (e. g., cazador, colector), y 6) periodo de actividad (e. g., nocturno, diurno). Se identificaron 22 gremios de aves y 27 de mam\'iferos. Este enfoque tiene como objetivo agrupar a las especies que utilizan los mismos recursos de una manera similar y destacar la utilidad de los gremios tr\'oficos en estudios que analicen la forma en que est\'an organizadas las comunidades bi\'oticas.},

  abstract = {The importance of spatial scale for {$\beta$}-diversity has been shown in several studies, but it is unclear how spatial diversity patterns correlate among different organismic groups. We studied spatial diversity organization of plants and several trophic guilds of beetles in beech-dominated forests in two regions of Germany to test whether different trophic guilds are organized independently in space. We applied multiplicative diversity partitioning using a nested hierarchical design of four increasingly broader spatial levels (subplot, plot, forest class, region) and tested for correlations among trophic guilds by using Pearson product moment correlations and Mantel-tests. We observed similar general diversity patterns at different trophic guilds showing a high contribution of {$\beta$}-diversity to total {$\gamma$}-diversity and found {$\beta$}-diversity to be higher at different spatial scales and {$\alpha$}-diversity to be lower than expected by random distributions of individuals. Results, however, partly depended on the weighting of rare and abundant species. Beta-diversity in our study was caused mainly by species spatial turnover rather than by nestedness. Correlations of {$\alpha$}-diversity between trophic guilds were low whereas correlations of {$\beta$}-diversity above subplot level were high. Importantly, more strongly connected trophic guilds revealed not generally stronger relationships than less strongly connected guilds. Three important implications for conservation can be deduced from our results: (1) heterogeneity of beech forests at different spatial scales should be supported in conservation strategies to enhance biodiversity and related functions; (2) the observed high importance of spatial turnover in relation to nestedness implies a concentration of conservation efforts to a large number of not necessarily the richest sites, and (3) recommendation for particular conservation strategies (e.g. selection of priority sites for conservation at regional scale) based on single indicator taxa or functional guild is difficult because of the varied response of the species in our study. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category-subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods - both sample-based and individual-based -allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

  abstract = {Successful tree regeneration is essential for sustainable forest management, yet it can be limited by the interaction of harvesting effects and multiple ecological drivers. In northern hardwood forests, for example, there is uncertainty whether low-intensity selection harvesting techniques will result in adequate and desirable regeneration. Our research is part of a long-term study that tests the hypothesis that a silvicultural approach called ``structural complexity enhancement\{''\} (SCE) can accelerate the development of late-successional forest structure and functions. Our objective is to understand the regeneration dynamics following three uneven-aged forestry treatments with high levels of retention: single-tree selection, group selection, and SCE. Regeneration density and diversity can be limited by differing treatment effects on or interactions among light availability, competitive environment, substrate, and herbivory. To explore these relationships, manipulations and controls were replicated across 2 ha treatment units at two Vermont sites. Forest inventory data were collected pre-harvest and periodically over 13 years post-harvest. We used mixed effects models with repeated measures to evaluate the effect of treatment on seedling and sapling density and diversity (Shannon-Weiner H'). The treatments were all successful in recruiting a sapling class with significantly greater sapling densities compared to the controls. However, undesirable and prolific beech (Fagus americana) sprouting dominates some patches in the understory of all the treatments, creating a high degree of spatial variability in the competitive environment for regeneration. Multivariate analyses suggest that while treatment had a dominant effect, other factors were influential in driving regeneration responses. These results indicate variants of uneven-aged systems that retain or enhance elements of stand structural complexity-including old-growth characteristics-can generally foster abundant regeneration of important late successional tree species depending on site conditions, but they may require beech control where beech sprouting inhibits desired regeneration.},

Five levels of retention of mature trees (2\%, 10\%, 20\%, 50\% or 75\% of the original basal area) were applied in stands dominated by aspen, white spruce or mixtures of the two species. Basal area of aspen (or that of aspen plus balsam poplar combined) prior to logging strongly influenced sucker density of aspen (or aspen + balsam poplar combined)and in some cases their growth. Nine years after harvest there was a decline in sucker density and volume ha(-1) with increasing retention levels of aspen (or both poplars combined); sucker density declined by 50\% when only 20\% of the original basal area was left in the stand. Retaining mature spruce trees in the stand had little influence on the number of suckers but did affect their total volume ha(-1). Thus, we suggest that by knowing stand aspen and balsam poplar density prior to logging and varying levels of retention of aspen and balsam poplar or conifers at harvest, the density of Populus regeneration can be predicted by managers, thereby allowing them to create a range of mixedwood conditions.

In fields that lack standardized terminology encoded in an ontology, including ecology and evolution, research teams can unintentionally exclude articles from the review by omitting synonymous phrases in their search terms.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}2.To combat these problems, we developed a quick, objective, reproducible method for generating search strategies that uses text mining and keyword co-occurrence networks to identify the most important terms for a review. The method reduces bias in search strategy development because it does not rely on a predetermined set of articles and can improve search recall by identifying synonymous terms that research teams might otherwise omit.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}3.When tested against the search strategies used in published environmental systematic reviews, our method performs as well as the published searches and retrieves gold-standard hits that replicated versions of the original searches do not.

  abstract = {1. Green tree retention and prescribed burning are the practices used to mitigate negative effects of boreal forestry. Beside their effects on biodiversity, these practices should also promote non-timber forest products (NTFPs). We assessed: (1) how prescribed burning and tree retention influence NTFPs by examining the production of bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus and cowberry, Vaccinium vitis-idaea; (2) if there are synergies or trade-offs in the delivery of these NTFPs in relation to the delivery of species richness, focusing on five groups of forest-dwelling species. 2. We used a long-term experiment located in eastern Finland, with three different harvesting treatments: clear-cut logging, logging with retention patches and unlogged, which were combined with or without prescribed burning. Eleven years after the treatment application, we scored plant cover and berry production in different microhabitats within these treatments, while species richness data for five species groups (ground layer lichens and bryophytes, vascular plants, saproxylic beetles, pollinators-here bees and hoverflies) were collected at the stand level. 3. Logging favoured cowberry production, particularly for plants growing in the vicinity of stumps. Logging was detrimental for cover and berry production of bilberry. Retention mitigated these negative effects slightly, but cover and berry production were still substantially lower compared to unlogged forests. Prescribed burning increased the cowberry production in retention patches and in unlogged forest. Bilberry production decreased with burning, except in unlogged forest where the effect was neutral. 4. No single management treatment simultaneously favoured all values-NTFPs and richness-and trade-offs among values were common. Only bilberry production and beetle diversity were higher under retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, compared to logged stands. Prescribed burning favoured many values when performed in combination with retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, but different treatment combinations favoured different species groups. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that widely applied conservation practices in managed boreal forests are unlikely to benefit all ecosystem values everywhere. If high multifunctionality is desired, managing at a landscape scale, countering the local trade-offs among values, may be more appropriate than the stand-scale conservation practices commonly practiced today.},

However a manual bird count is a time consuming and cumbersome process, requiring several people going from nest to nest counting the birds and the clutches. High resolution imagery, generated with a UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) offer an interesting alternative. Experiences and results of UAS surveys for automatic bird count of the last two years are presented for the bird reserve island Langenwerder. For 2011 1,568 birds(+/- 5 \%.) were detected on the image mosaic, based on multispectral image classification and GIS-based post processing. Based on the experiences of 2011 the results and the accuracy of the automatic bird count 2012 became more efficient. For 2012 1,938 birds with an accuracy of approx. +/- 3 \% were counted. Additionally a separation of breeding and non-breeding birds was performed with the assumption, that standing birds cause a visible shade. The final section of the paper is devoted to the analysis of the 3D-point cloud. Thereby the point cloud was used to determine the height of the vegetation and the extend and depth of closed sinks, which are unsuitable for breeding birds.}

Since re-growth of trees can be slow and management cycles can span over 100 years, long-term longitudinal data are needed to assess the effects of forestry on organisms living in these habitats. Here, we draw upon 50 years of population data of an open-nesting, sedentary bird species, typically of boreal forests, the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus). Forests at the study site were managed by clear-cutting and re-plantation, and a management cycle spanning over 120 years. We tracked changes in forest structure in the nest vicinity and the whole territory with the help of aerial images, and linked them to territory occupancy and offspring production in 13 territories. While territories were occupied in 77.2\% of all instances, reproduction was only successful in 19.6\% of all instances. Both parameters were positively influenced by a large proportion of unthinned forests older than 50 years, which provide visual protection from nest and adult predators. Thus, it is crucial to assess both territory occupancy and reproductive output to understand the effects of forestry on bird populations. Moreover, our results suggest that in forests with slow turnover cycles, management which avoids thinning (such as green tree retention forestry) can promote population persistence of open-nesting bird species.

ABSTRACT The Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) is a species of high conservation importance because of its low overall density and long-term widespread population declines on the breeding grounds. Results of previous research on the species suggest that its breeding habitat preferences vary across its range. However, the underlying processes associated with habitat use are unknown. Using a 20 yr dataset, we developed occupancy models for Canada Warblers to determine the influence of habitat characteristics (e.g., understory vegetation, canopy cover), landscape context (e.g., edge, forest patch size), and species co-occurrence on occupancy, colonization, and local extinction parameters. Our results show that multiple habitats are used by Canada Warblers on the breeding grounds; common variables associated with large-scale, long-term occupancy dynamics are forest age, landscape composition at the 100 m and 500 m scales, and mean patch size. Overall, Canada Warblers were nearly twice as persistent in mature forest stands (.80 yr) and large, mixed forest stands. Further, models indicated that species co-occurrence was an important predictor of Canada Warbler occupancy in some cover types. The results of this study increase our understanding of population processes over large, dynamic landscapes and provide essential conservation information to improve habitat and landscape management for the Canada Warbler.},

  abstract = {Contemporary forest management is increasingly focused on maintaining ecosystem function and services including biodiversity conservation. As a result, harvest guidelines related to retention of live trees and woody biomass (fine and coarse residue arising from harvesting) have been developed to provide benefits for wildlife, but there is much uncertainty on the effectiveness of these guidelines depending on stage of succession, retention levels, and focal taxa. We used an operational-scale, fully replicated factorial experiment to determine the effects of both tree retention (none, dispersed, aggregated) and woody residue harvesting (no removal, 20\% retention, all removed) on breeding bird and small mammal communities in aspen forests 7-8 years after harvest. Bird community metric responses showed a clear and consistent positive response to tree retention; both tree retention configurations resulted in higher total abundance, increased diversity, and higher species richness compared to stands with no tree retention. There was no difference in community metrics between the retention configurations and no evidence that early successional species were negatively affected by tree retention. Total abundance of small mammals was lower in clear-cuts compared to tree retention treatments; moreover, clear-cut stands had lower species diversity compared to stands with the aggregated tree retention. There were limited effects of biomass harvest treatments on small mammal communities, likely because actual biomass removal was much lower than experimental targets. Overall, our results provide conclusive evidence on the continued benefits of tree retention on wildlife communities se0ven and eight years post-harvest in regenerating aspen forests.},

  abstract = {Multidimensional analysis of traits are now a common toolkit in ecology and evolution and are based on trait-spaces in which each dimension summarise the observed trait combination (a morphospace or an ecospace). Observations of interest will typically occupy a subset of this trait-space, and researchers will apply one or more metrics to quantify the way in which organisms ``inhabit'' that trait-space. In macroevolution and ecology these metrics are referred to as disparity or dissimilarity metrics and can be generalised as space occupancy metrics. Researchers use these metrics to investigate how space occupancy changes through time, in relation to other groups of organisms, and in response to global environmental changes, such as global warming events or mass extinctions. However, the mathematical and biological meaning of most space occupancy metrics is vague with the majority of widely-used metrics lacking formal description.Here we propose a broad classification of space occupancy metrics into three categories that capture changes in volume, density, or position. We analyse the behaviour of 25 metrics to study changes in trait-space volume, density and position on a series of simulated and empirical datasets.We find no one metric describes all of trait-space but that some metrics are better at capturing certain aspects compared to other approaches and that their performance depends on both the trait-space and the hypothesis analysed. However, our results confirm the three broad categories (volume, density and position) and allow to relate changes in any of these categories to biological phenomena.Since the choice of space occupancy metric should be specific to the data and question at had, we introduced moms, a user-friendly tool based on a graphical interface that allows users to both visualise and measure changes space occupancy for any metric in simulated or imported trait-spaces. Users are also provided with tools to transform their data in space (e.g. contraction, displacement, etc.). This tool is designed to help researchers choose the right space occupancy metrics, given the properties of their trait-space and their biological question.},

  abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. \textcopyright{} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Vegetation structure is identified as an important biodiversity indicator providing the physical environment that generates, supports, and maintains forest biodiversity. Airborne lidar systems (light detection and ranging) have the capacity to accurately measure three-dimensional vegetation structure, and have been widely used in wildlife habitat mapping and species distribution modeling. Large\textendash area structural inventories using lidar-derived vari-ables that characterize generic habitat structure have rarely been done, yet would be helpful for guiding biodiver-sity monitoring and conservation assessments of species at regional levels. This study provides a novel approach for processing regional-scale lidar data into categorical classes representing natural groupings of habitat struc-ture. We applied cluster analysis on six lidar-derived habitat-related variables to classify vegetation structure into eight classes for the forested areas of ten natural subregions in boreal and foothill forests in Alberta, Canada. Structure classes were compared across different natural subregions and under anthropogenic/non-anthropo-genic disturbance regimes. We found that the Lower Foothills Natural Subregions had the most complex vegeta-tion structure, and wildfire was the most prevalent disturbance agent for all classes except for the rarest class (i.e. stands with high standard deviations of height and low canopy cover) which was more heavily altered by timber harvesting. This data product provides continuous, regional mapping of vegetation structure directly measured from lidar, with a spatial resolution (30 m) relatively finer than what was provided by polygon-based forest in-ventories. This vegetation structure classification and its associated spatial distribution address the fundamental issue of habitat structure in biodiversity monitoring. It can serve as a base layer used together with species and land cover data for forest resources planning, species distribution and animal movement modeling, as well as pri-oritization of conservation efforts on critical habitat structures.},

General conclusions were that retention trees (1) provide some of the substrate types required by early-successional species, (2) alleviate the most serious consequences of clear-cutting on biota, and (3) cannot maintain characteristics of intact mature forests. Larger volumes and more trees tend to maintain diversity better. There is a particular lack of studies on dispersal, landscape effects and long-term dynamics. There is a need to study further the relationship between the biota and the amount of trees, as well as their spatial arrangement. Retention trees should preferably be evaluated in relation to other components in multiscaled conservation, including woodland key habitats and larger protected areas.},

We conducted a meta-analysis to increase the available evidence for nest-site selection of cavity-nesting birds. Literature was searched in Web of Science and Google Scholar and included studies that provide data on the habitat requirements of cavity-nesting birds in temperate and boreal forests of varying naturalness. To compare nest and non-nest-tree characteristics, the following data were collected from the literature: diameter at breast height (DBH) and its standard deviation (SD), sample size of trees with and without active nest, amount of nest and available trees described as dead or with a broken crown, and amount of nest and available trees that were lacking these characteristics. Further collected data included bird species nesting in the cavities and nest-building type (nonexcavator/excavator), forest type (coniferous/deciduous/mixed), biome (temperate/boreal), and naturalness (managed/natural). From these data, three effect sizes were calculated that describe potential nest trees in terms of DBH, vital status (dead/alive), and crown status (broken/intact). These tree characteristics can be easily recognized by foresters. The results show that on average large-diameter trees, dead trees, and trees with broken crowns were selected for nesting. The magnitude of this effect varied depending primarily on bird species and the explanatory variables forest type and naturalness. Biome had lowest influence (indicated by AIC). We conclude that diameter at breast height, vitality, and crown status can be used as tree characteristics for the selection of trees that should be retained in selectively harvested forests.},

We studied the effects of varying levels and patterns of green-tree retention on the community composition of bark-dwelling arthropods. Arthropods were sampled with crawl traps installed on 280 live trees and 260 snags (all Douglas-fir) at three locations (experimental blocks) in the western Cascade Range of Oregon and Washington. Sampling coincided with the breeding season of the brown creeper (Certhia americana), a primary avian predator, in 2003 and 2004. Within each block, arthropods were collected in five. 13-ha experimental units-a control (uncut forest) and four treatments representing one of two levels of retention (15\% vs. 40\% of original basal area) and one of two spatial patterns (trees dispersed vs. aggregated in 1-ha patches). In total, 166,234 arthropods predominantly Collembola (70\%) - were collected over the course of study. With the exception of Collembola, arachnids were the most abundant arthropods (23\% of individuals); spiders (Araneae) accounted for {$>$}95\% of arachnids. Other common insect orders included adult Coleoptera (16\%), Hemiptera (15\%), and Diptera (12\%). For all insects combined (excluding Collembola), activity-density (daily catch per trap, an index of abundance) was significantly greater in harvest treatments than in controls. The greatest increases were found at 15\% retention-densities were 2.6 times greater than in controls and 1.8 times greater than at 40\% retention. Pattern of retention did not affect abundance of most arthropod groups, although two families of spiders (Linyphiidae and Thomisidae) were more abundant in dispersed than in aggregated treatments. Traps on live trees yielded 2.2 times more arthropods than did traps on snags likely reflecting differences in food resources. A high proportion of herbivorous taxa showed negative associations with local density and basal area of overstory trees and positive associations with cover of herbs, suggesting that many corticolous arthropods originate in the understory and respond positively to increases in vegetation cover following retention harvests. The numerical dominance of Collembola and high abundance of Diplopoda also suggest important ecological ties between communities of corticolous and detrital (litter-dwelling) arthropods.

More than 47,000 arthropods were collected during two 6-week periods in 2003 and 2004. All harvest treatments had positive effects on the activity-density (relative abundance) of spiders. Groups typically associated with open habitats showed particularly large responses (6.3-7.5 greater abundance than in controls). In contrast, species characteristic of old forest exhibited 57-84\% lower abundance in harvest treatments than in controls. Abundance of carabid beetles was 60\% lower among harvest treatments than controls reflecting declines in forest-dependent taxa. Among harvest treatments we did not detect a significant effect of level or pattern of retention for most groups of predatory arthropods. However, we documented significant variation in response within aggregated treatments. As a group, spiders were more abundant at edge and intermediate positions (15 m from edge), than at the centers of aggregates. In contrast, carabids showed significant declines at the edge. Correlation and ordination analyses revealed significant relationships between local abundance/composition of arthropod taxa and selected habitat attributes (e.g., tree density and basal area, cover of disturbed soil and herbs), consistent with treatment effects. Our results suggest that 5-7 years after harvest, habitat conditions were not suitable in any treatment to support the abundance and diversity of taxa present in late-seral forests.

Main reasons are habitat loss and deterioration, due to a simplified forest composition, including a reduction in old trees and dead wood. In Sweden, measures to counter the loss of biodiversity are taken at forest harvesting, and include forest harvest retention. Areas of high conservation values (AHCV) have been identified in Sweden to prioritise conservation efforts, but so far these areas have not been used when making decisions about forest harvest retention. In this study, we tested if dead wood from forest harvest retention is used by more dead wood-dependent insect species (24 beetles and four other insects, redlisted or indicating high biodiversity) on clearcuts within than outside of AHCVs and whether the composition of the surrounding landscape influences species occurrence. There were not more dead wood-dependent insect species per clearcut within AHCVs than outside. The surrounding landscape had an influence on the species richness on clearcuts, but in several cases the pattern was the opposite of our hypotheses. Increased standing volume of relevant tree species, however, tended to increase the occurrence or number of associated species. The designation of ACHVs in Sweden is not related with occurrence of dead wood or dead wood-dependent organisms. We also found that landscape context can have effects on species richness. The result urges for better planning so that ACHV areas are designated in landscapes where their potential for conservation of dead wood-dependent organisms is highest.},

  abstract = {Green tree retention is often applied in forests otherwise harvested by clearcutting. Its aim is to support biodiversity by contributing to a continuity of living trees and large-diameter dead wood in the new generation of a forest. However, high levels of mortality can undermine the aims of tree retention and pose a concern for forest managers. Therefore, knowledge about the mortality of retention trees over the long term is needed. We calculated cumulative tree mortality for the seven most common tree species up to 20 years after clearcutting based on a chronosequence of dead and living trees in 583 tree groups on 206 clearcuts distributed over a wide area in boreal central Sweden. For all tree taxa combined and for the three most common tree taxa (Scots pine, Norway spruce and two birch species) we modeled tree mortality based on structural and environmental variables measured for each tree group and characteristics of the clearcut using generalized linear mixed effects models. The cumulative mortality averaged over all clearcut ages was 12\% for Scots pine, 25\% for Norway spruce and 16\% for birch. Only 10\% of all retention tree groups had a mortality {$>$}50\%. Key factors reducing mortality for all tree taxa combined were tree density, tree volume of a retention group and the position at a former stand edge abutting open habitat, while a high wind exposure increased tree mortality. For the three most common species (pine, spruce, birch), the same factors as for all taxa combined were of importance, except tree density that resulted in species specific responses. For pine and spruce, the presence of seed trees on the clearcut reduced mortality. Increased mortality was additionally observed on wet soils. Mortality increased with tree height in birch and with diameter and slenderness ratio in spruce. Generally, a focus on retaining trees in groups with large tree volumes and tree density in less wind exposed positions and on forest edges will decrease the mortality after clearcutting and thus also reduce dead wood input.

  abstract = {In many regions of the world, variable retention has replaced clear-cutlogging as the principal method of regeneration harvest. Partial retention of the overstory is thought to ensure greater continuity of the species and ecological processes that characterize older forests. Level (amount) and spatial pattern of overstory retention are two basic elements of forest structure that can be manipulated to achieve specific ecological or silvicultural objectives. However, experiments that elucidate the relative importance of retention level and pattern (or their interaction) are rare. Here we assess long-term (.10 yr) responses of forest understories to experimental harvests of mature coniferous forests replicated at five sites in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Treatments contrast both the level of retention (40\% vs. 15\% of original basal area) and its spatial distribution (dispersed vs. aggregated in 1-ha patches). For most vascular plant groups (early seral, forest generalist, and late seral), postharvest changes in cover and richness were reduced at higher levels of retention and in dispersed relative to aggregated treatments. Although retained forest patches were stable, changes in adjacent harvested (cleared) areas were significantly greater than in dispersed treatments. Late-seral herbs were highly sensitive to level and pattern of retention, with extirpations most frequent in the cleared areas of aggregated treatments and at low levels of dispersed retention. In contrast, early-seral species were most abundant in these environments. Forest-floor bryophytes exhibited large and persistent declines regardless of treatment, suggesting that threshold levels of disturbance or stress were exceeded. Our results indicate that 15\% retention (the minimum standard on federal forestlands in the PNW) is insufficient to retain the abundance or diversity of species characteristic of late-seral forests. Although 1-ha aggregates provide refugia, they are susceptible to edge effects or stochastic processes; thus, smaller aggregates are unlikely to serve this function. The ability to achieve multiple ecological or silvicultural objectives with variable retention will require the spatial partitioning of habitats to include dispersed retention and larger undisturbed aggregates along with cleared areas.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Variable retention (VR) has been adopted globally as an alternative to more intensive forms of regeneration harvest. By retaining live trees within harvest units, VR seeks balance among the commodity, ecological, and aesthetic values of managed forests. Achieving these multiple, often competing objectives requires an understanding of how level and spatial pattern of retention shape the abundance, growth, and mortality of regenerating and retained trees. Using long-term (18-19 yr) data from a regional-scale VR experiment, we explore the individual and interactive effects of retention level (15\% vs. 40\% of initial basal area) and pattern (dispersed vs. aggregated) on the post-harvest dynamics of forests of differing structure and seral composition. Level and pattern of retention imposed tradeoffs for the density and growth of regenerating trees ({$\geq$}0.1 m tall, \&lt;5 cm dbh) and ingrowth (trees attaining 5 cm during the study). Greater retention led to greater density of late-seral regeneration, but lower density of early-seral ingrowth, and slower growth of late-seral ingrowth. Dispersed retention enhanced the density of early- and late-seral regeneration (compared to aggregated treatments), but reduced the growth of early-seral ingrowth. We also observed tradeoffs for retained trees. Lower retention enhanced the growth of smaller trees (\&lt;25 cm dbh)\textemdash particularly in dispersed settings\textemdash but reduced the survival of larger trees, which were more susceptible to windthrow. Greater retention reduced the growth, but enhanced the survival of smaller trees. Pattern imposed similar tradeoffs, with dispersed retention enhancing growth, but reducing survival of small trees. Finally, level and pattern resulted in tradeoffs for productivity of regenerating vs. retained-tree cohorts. Ingrowth productivity was greater at lower retention and in aggregated treatments; retained-tree productivity was greater at higher retention and in dispersed treatments. Our results provide a unique, long-term perspective on the sensitivity of tree regeneration, growth, and mortality to key structural elements of VR systems. Strong responses to level and pattern of retention produce tradeoffs for different ecological or resource objectives. Balancing these objectives may require the combined use of aggregates, dispersed retention, and clearings, to mimic the spatial heterogeneity of habitats, physical structures, and resource conditions that are produced by natural disturbances.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Retention forestry is widely used for reducing the negative biodiversity impacts of forest management. Its effectiveness depends, however, on the post-harvest dynamics of the retention trees, which in turn are likely affected by both tree- and stand-level factors. Understanding the effects of these factors on tree dynamics is thus essential for evaluating the biodiversity effects of retention forestry. We studied the impact of tree-level factors on the mortality and falling patterns of retention trees in pine-dominated boreal forests of eastern Finland. In total, 2738 retention trees were followed individually for 10 years after harvest on 12 study sites with an initial retention level of either 10 or 50 m(3) ha(-1). Prescribed burning was applied to half of the sites after harvest. Effects of tree species (pine, spruce or deciduous), diameter and location (grouped or scattered trees) on tree mortality and tree fall after death were assessed using survival analysis. During the 10-year survey period, 55\% of the trees died and 81\% of the dead trees fell down. The risk of mortality decreased with increasing diameter in all tree species on burned sites. On unburned sites, this applied only to pines and deciduous trees whereas for spruce the largest trees had the highest mortality. On all sites, dispersed trees had higher mortality than grouped trees. Pines had a lower risk to fall down after dying than spruces or deciduous trees. We conclude that tree species, diameter and location can be used to predict the post-harvest mortality and falling of retention trees and to select trees that best meet the aims of retention. However, considering the biodiversity effects, the predicted tree dynamics should not be the only basis for tree selection, but the habitat value of the retained trees must be accounted for as well.

In this paper, a novel signal processing method is used to correctly measure 3D voxelised vegetation cover from full-waveform ALS data at 1.5 m horizontal and 50 cm vertical resolution, including understorey vegetation and within-canopy structure. A new method for calibrating and validating the instrument specific ALS processing using high resolution TLS data is also presented and used to calibrate and validate the ALS derived data products over a wide range of land cover types within a heterogeneous urban area, including woodland, gardens and streets. This showed the method to accurately retrieve voxelised canopy cover maps with less than 0.4\% of voxels containing false negatives, 10\% of voxels containing false positives and a canopy cover accuracy within vox-els of 24\%. The method was applied across 100 km 2 and the resulting structure maps were compared to the more widely used discrete return ALS and Gaussian decomposed waveform ALS data products. These products were found to give little information on the within-canopy structure and so are only capable of deriving coarse resolution, plot-scale structure metrics. The detailed 3D canopy maps derived from the new method allow landscape scale ecosystem processes to be examined in more detail than has previously been possible, and the new method reveals details about the canopy understorey, creating opportunities for ecological investigations. The calibration method can be applied to any waveform ALS instrument and processing method.

We evaluated whether density was a useful surrogate of habitat quality for the White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), an apparent habitat generalist, in a recently logged landscape near Calling Lake, Alberta, Canada. We detected significant differences in the territory density of birds among three distinct habitat types: interior forest, forest edges, and recent (4- to 6-yr-old) clear-cuts. However, the observed patterns in territory density were not consistent with several indices of habitat quality. We found a consistent and marked gradient for indices such as nesting success (based on a reproductive index), pairing success, and the proportion of territories that successfully fledged young between interior forest sites and clear-cuts. Edge habitats, in which high relative density offset lower reproductive success, represented moderate-quality habitat for this species. Our results suggest that the continued use of density alone, without some measure of habitat quality, is insufficient if not misleading when evaluating response to habitat change. Our results have important implications for understanding the population dynamics of this species, which is often overlooked in population-level studies yet continues to experience long-term population declines over large portions of its breeding range.},

  abstract = {We investigated whether impacts on boreal forest songbird communities in northwestern Alberta could be mitigated through a harvesting system that attempts to emulate the local natural disturbance regime. The EMEND (Ecosystem Management by Emulating Natural Disturbance) project is a multidisciplinary experiment to compare clearcuts and partial-retention cuts in four upland cover types with uncut forest and with experimentally burned stands. We studied breeding birds at EMEND between 1998 (pretreatment) and 2000, focusing on their responses to partial harvesting. Partial cuts were generally intermediate (and varied in a linear fashion) between clearcuts and undisturbed forest for community and species measures. Species that declined in abundance in partial cuts were typically dependent on shrubs and trees, whereas species that benefited were typically ground nesters. While partial cutting offered some advantages over clear-cutting in conserving short-term avian diversity, we suggest that low retention levels (i.e., 10\%, 20\%) cannot be justified from this perspective. The benefits that accrued in these treatments were relatively small, and species that declined or disappeared were typically characteristic of mature forest habitats. Higher retention levels (i.e., 50\%, 75\%) may conserve some species of concern, but the extent to which these treatments offer productivity advantages over lower residuals requires further study.Les auteurs ont voulu v\~A\textcopyright rifier si les impacts sur les communaut\~A\textcopyright s de passereaux forestiers dans le nord-ouest de l'Alberta pouvaient \~A\textordfeminine tre att\~A\textcopyright nu\~A\textcopyright s par un syst\~A\textasciidieresis me de r\~A\textcopyright colte qui tente d'\~A\textcopyright muler le r\~A\textcopyright gime local de perturbations naturelles.

  abstract = {Globally, seabirds are vulnerable to anthropogenic threats both at sea and on land. Seabirds typically nest colonially and show strong fidelity to natal colonies, and such colonies on low-lying islands may be threatened by sea-level rise. We used French Frigate Shoals, the largest atoll in the Hawaiian Archipelago, as a case study to explore the population dynamics of seabird colonies and the potential effects sea-level rise may have on these rookeries. We compiled historic observations, a 30-year time series of seabird population abundance, lidar-derived elevations, and aerial imagery of all the islands of French Frigate Shoals. To estimate the population dynamics of 8 species of breeding seabirds on Tern Island from 1980 to 2009, we used a Gompertz model with a Bayesian approach to infer population growth rates, density dependence, process variation, and observation error. All species increased in abundance, in a pattern that provided evidence of density dependence. Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor), Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra), Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), Spectacled Terns (Onychoprion lunatus), and White Terns (Gygis alba) are likely at carrying capacity. Density dependence may exacerbate the effects of sea-level rise on seabirds because populations near carrying capacity on an island will be more negatively affected than populations with room for growth. We projected 12\% of French Frigate Shoals will be inundated if sea level rises 1 m and 28\% if sea level rises 2 m. Spectacled Terns and shrub-nesting species are especially vulnerable to sea-level rise, but seawalls and habitat restoration may mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. Losses of seabird nesting habitat may be substantial in the Hawaiian Islands by 2100 if sea levels rise 2 m. Restoration of higher-elevation seabird colonies represent a more enduring conservation solution for Pacific seabirds.},

  abstract = {We studied the effects of patch retention felling and soil scarification by harrowing on the coverage and species richness of epixylic species in boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in Southern Finland. The epixylics were investigated from both the retention tree groups (RTGs) and the surrounding felling areas before and after fellings and after scarification on consecutive years. The cover percentage of all included species groups was shown to decrease after the felling, especially in the felling areas (vascular plants, -0.4\%; mosses, -27.8\%; liverworts, -4.0\%; and lichens,-2.1\%). The decrease was considerable also in the RTGs. The amount of dead moss increased in both the areas indicating microclimatic changes. Species richness also declined rapidly after the first year, especially in the felling areas (vascular plants, -2.2\%; mosses, -27.3\%; liverworts, -30.3\%; and lichens, -22.9\%). Scarification also decreases covers and species richness of bryophytes. After the second year, the covers of the species groups generally started to regain, especially in the untreated RTGs. The size of RTG was in positive correlation with the total species number. Another main result indicates that it is possible to maintain much higher initial vegetation abundance and diversity in the RTGs than in the felling areas. Coarse woody debris formed by the frequent tree uprootings may also enhance the long-term survival of epixylics over forest regeneration period. RTGs should be at least 10 times larger than the size used in current Finnish forestry, so that they could function as species refugia.},

Therefore, it is important to understand properties of the point process distribution. We examine how the hier-archical species distribution modeling framework has been used to incorporate a wide array of regression and theory-based components while accounting for the data collection process and making use of auxiliary information. The hier-archical modeling framework allows us to demonstrate how several commonly used species distribution models can be derived from the point process distribution, highlight areas of potential overlap between different models, and suggest areas where further research is needed.},

Heterogeneity in horizontal and vertical forest structure underpinned most HDRs, followed by plant diversity, deadwood and topographic heterogeneity, but the relative importance varied even within the same trophic level. Among substantial HDRs, 53\% increased monotonically, consistent with the classical habitat heterogeneity hypothesis but 21\% were hump-shaped, 25\% had a monotonically decreasing slope and 1\% showed no clear pattern. Overall, we found no evidence of a single generalizable mechanism determining HDR patterns.},

Although widely used, the effects of these methods on species assemblages in the longer term are still relatively unknown. In 2000, we established a large-scale replicated field experiment to explore the effects of prescribed burning and tree retention (four levels: 0, ten and 50 m(3) ha(-1) and unharvested control) on saproxylic beetles. Assemblages were monitored over 10 post-treatment years. Our results showed that species richness of predators was increased by burning of the forest stand. Early- and late-stage xylophagous species increased in the first post-harvest year. Increased logging intensity led to a decrease in mycetophagous, early-stage xylophagous and predator species richness over the ten year period. In the burned unharvested stands, the total species richness remained high after ten years, but decreased to the pretreatment level in the stands with retention trees, and to even lower levels in the clear-cuts. Furthermore, the saproxylic beetle assemblages in the burned unharvested stands differed from the assemblages in any of the harvested stands. Burning increased pyrophilous and rare and red-listed (RRL) species richness. Over the ten year period, the richness of those species collapsed in the harvested stands, but increased in the burned unharvested stands. Our results emphasize the difference in tree stand legacies between logging and natural disturbance, but also indicates that prescribed burning and retention forestry have the potential to alleviate the negative effects of forest management on biodiversity in the longer term.

The assumed positive effects of retention trees, however, depend on the dynamics of trees in providing substrates or structures for forest-dwelling organisms. In 2000 an experimental study was established to investigate the effects of different retention levels (10 m(3) ha(-1) and 50 m(3) ha(-1)) and fire on tree dynamics. In total, 2758 individually marked, initially living, retention trees were followed on 12 sites in eastern Finland over 10 post-harvest years. Over half (59\%) of the total volume of the retention trees died during these initial 10 years, and burning resulted in much higher mortality (84\% vs. 34\% on unburned sites). At lower retention levels, retention trees did not provide continuity of habitat substrates since all trees died quickly. Fire shortened the tree availability, due to increased tree mortality. However, in higher retention levels, burned areas maintained diverse deadwood substrates for an extended period. Our study proved that tree retention can maintain the continuity of dead wood over early successional stages, if the level of retention is high enough. Fire, combined with higher retention level, created diverse assemblages of dead and living trees. At lower retention levels, however, the effect of fire can be too severe for maintaining living trees or continuity of diverse dead wood. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {1. Fire suppression and reduced volumes of dead wood have led to a major decline in pyrophilous and saproxylic insects in Fennoscandian boreal forests. As a consequence, several species are currently seriously threatened. Flat bugs (Heteroptera, Aradidae) is an important invertebrate group that includes several pyrophilous species, including many threatened ones. 2. We explored whether specific conservation measures - prescribed burning and retention forestry - can facilitate the survival of flat bugs in managed forests. The large-scale field experiment consisted of a burning treatment (yes/no) and four levels of logging intensity (clear-cut, retention levels of 10 and 50 m(3) ha(-1), and unharvested controls). The data included 1224 individuals of 12 species, sampled over a 4-year period. 3. Burning increased the species richness and abundance of the pyrophilous species. Two Red-Listed and very rare pyrophilous species, Aradus angularis J. Sahlberg (Vulnerable) and A. laeviusculus Reuter (Near Threatened), were abundant after burning. The number of non-pyrophilous flat bugs collapsed after burning but they re-colonised the stands quickly, becoming as abundant as at the unburned stands. Logging increased the abundance of flat bugs only when retention forestry was applied. 4. This study shows that pyrophilous flat bugs are quickly able to locate recently burned forests and that these forests are important for their survival. The effect of fire is, however, transient at the stand level and pyrophilous species disappear almost completely quickly after fire. To maintain these species, recently burned forests with a sufficient volume of retention trees should be available continuously at the landscape level.},

Prescribed burning and retention forestry are commonly applied to better maintain naturally occurring legacies, but the community-level effects of different disturbances on the functional characteristics of biota remains still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of prescribed fire, clear-cutting and retention forestry on the functional properties of saproxylic beetle assemblages in Eastern Finland, using stand-level data from a before-after field experiment with four levels of tree retention (0, 10 and 50 m(3) ha(-1) and control) and prescribed burning. We analyzed the fun.ctional-phylogenetic diversity and a set of species traits that link species to resources. The data include 377 beetle species and 38549 individuals. Functional-phylogenetic diversity decreased from a random to a clustered pattern after burning and logging with retention trees, indicating environmental filtering of both processes. These effects became more pronounced with increasing logging intensity. Species-level traits that were favored by burning and tree retention were connected to open-habitat conditions and fresh dead wood, whereas clear-cutting revealed a random pattern without reference to specific resources. Our functional approach thus shows that clear-cutting does not mimic the dynamics of wildfire, but leads to different functional composition of species assemblages. Therefore, prescribed burning or wildfire should be incorporated and sufficient amount of trees retained in forest management to conserve functional processes and natural composition of saproxylic species assemblages in boreal forests.

  abstract = {Aggregated retention is now a common method of regeneration harvest in forest ecosystems managed for both timber and ecological objectives. If residual forest aggregates are to serve as temporary refugia for species sensitive to disturbance or environmental stress, microclimatic conditions must be sufficiently buffered to allow for their persistence. In 1-ha aggregates at three experimental sites in western Washington, we quantified spatial gradients in microclimate (light, air and soil temperature, and soil moisture), effects of aspect on these gradients, and how microclimate compared to conditions in adjacent harvest areas and larger tracts of undisturbed forest (controls). Light availability and temperature, were greatest at the edge, but declined sharply inside the aggregate, with most change occurring within 20 m of the edge. Beyond this distance, light generally declined to levels observed in the controls. Soil temperatures exhibited greater spatial variation and stabilized further from the edge (10-30 m), but air temperatures were generally higher than those in controls. Soil moisture exhibited no spatial trends and was comparable among aggregates, harvest areas, and controls. Aspect exerted strong effects on light and temperature, particularly within 15 m of the edge, as did forest structure. Where tree density was low, microclimatic gradients were less steep and aspect-related differences were small. Comparisons with previous studies of ground vegetation indicate that microclimatic effects were consistent, in part, with declines among some groups of vascular and non-vascular plants; however, these declines were restricted to edge environments (5-10 m) and were unaffected by aspect. Our results suggest that 1-ha aggregates are sufficiently large to contain areas with light, temperature, and soil moisture that are comparable to those in undisturbed forest and suitable, in the short-term, for persistence of forest-dependent species.},

We examined patterns of transmitted light (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD), air and soil temperature, and soil moisture across a broad gradient of dispersed retention in mature, coniferous forests at three locations in western Washington. Treatment means and within-treatment variation (coefficients of variation among sample points within treatments) were compared for warm, sunny days in 6-7-year-old experimental harvest units representing 0, 15, 40, and 100\% retention of original basal area. Multiple linear regression was used to explore relationships between microclimate and plot-scale measures of forest structure (including overstory attributes, understory vegetation, and logging slash). PPFD and mean and maximum air and soil temperatures decreased with level of retention. PPFD showed the strongest response, but did not differ between 40 and 100\% retention. Mean and maximum air temperatures were significantly greater at 0 and 15\% retention than at 100\%. Among harvest treatments (0, 15, and 40\%), mean air temperature was significantly lower at 40 than at 0\%, but maximum air temperature did not differ among treatments. Mean and maximum soil temperatures differed only between 0 and 100\% retention. Minimum air and soil temperatures and late-summer soil moisture did not differ among treatments. Within-treatment variability (coefficient of variation, CV) did not differ significantly with level of retention for any of the variables sampled, but CVs for soil temperature showed a consistent increase with decreasing retention. In combination, topography, residual forest structure, and understory variables were good predictors of PPFD and mean and maximum temperatures (R-2 of 0.55-0.85 in multiple regression models), but were poorer predictors of minimum temperatures and soil moisture (R-2 of 0.10-0.51). Canopy cover appeared most frequently in the models and cover of understory vegetation was a significant predictor in models of soil temperature. Trends in microclimate among experimental treatments were consistent, in large part, with the early responses of bryophyte, herbaceous, and fungal communities at these sites. Our results suggest that 15\% retention, the current minimum standard on federal forests within the range of the northern spotted owl, does little to ameliorate microclimatic conditions relative to traditional clearcut logging.

  abstract = {Measures of forest fragmentation, and how fragmentation is changing through time, offer required information for understanding the status and dynamics of forest ecosystems, habitat conditions, and ecosystem functions. In this research, we investigate the multi-temporal characterization of forest fragmentation across the forested ecosystems of Canada ({$>$}650 million ha) and characterize the past three decades of forest fragmentation, providing useful context against which future analyses can be compared. Using 33 years of annual land cover maps produced from classified Landsat image best-available pixel composites (1984\textendash 2016), we describe and quantify the different forest patterns and dynamics that emerged in areas that were not disturbed in the analysis period, as well as following stand-replacing (i.e., wildfire, harvest) and non-stand-replacing (e.g., insects, water stress) disturbances. Baseline levels of fragmentation for each ecozone were determined by analyzing unchanged areas. Fragmentation dynamics by dominant forest disturbance showed that harvest activities generally lead to an increase in fragmentation related to the amount of forest cover (composition), while wildfires result in increasing fragmentation as a function of the spatial arrangement of the forest. The results presented herein also allow for characterization of the recovery of vegetation spatial patterns following various disturbance types, with areas dominated by fire presenting slower spatial recovery rates compared to harvest. By the end of the analysis period following disturbance events, forest fragmentation metrics in harvest-dominated landscapes were comparable to the pre-harvesting baseline, reaching 96\% of mean pre-disturbance levels for mean forest patch size, and 83\% for number of forest patches. In contrast, fire-dominated landscapes resulted in more event related fragmentation, with reduced forest cover (mean Thiel Sen slope = -0.13\% year-1), mean forest patch size (-0.22 ha year-1), an increase in forest patches (0.11 year-1), and forest\textendash non-forest join counts (0.83 year-1). By the end of the analysis period following disturbance events, mean forest patch size reached 52\% of mean pre-disturbance levels and 68\% the number of forest patches. Overall, non-stand replacing changes had no impact on the behaviour of the forest fragmentation metrics. The open access to Landsat's image archive combined with the analysis methods presented herein enable the systematic quantification and characterization of Canada-wide trends in forest fragmentation trends and post-disturbance spatial patterns over three decades. The results reported herein provide detailed information on the temporal evolution of spatial forest patterns, and illustrate that given an adequate time period, spatial patterns in areas where land use has not changed, recover to resemble pre-disturbance conditions.},

Landscape metrics are a widely used tool for the analysis of patch-based, discrete land-cover classes. Existing software to calculate landscape metrics has several constraints, such as being limited to a single platform, not being open-source or involving a complicated integration into large workflows. We present landscapemetrics, an open-source R package that overcomes many constraints of existing landscape metric software. The package includes an extensive collection of commonly used landscape metrics in a tidy workflow. To facilitate the integration into large workflows, landscapemetrics is based on a well-established spatial framework in R. This allows pre-processing of land-cover maps or further statistical analysis without importing and exporting the data from and to different software environments. Additionally, the package provides many utility functions to visualize, extract, and sample landscape metrics. Lastly, we provide building-blocks to motivate the development and integration of new metrics in the future. We demonstrate the usage and advantages of landscapemetrics by analysing the influence of different sampling schemes on the estimation of landscape metrics. In so doing, we demonstrate the many advantages of the package, especially its easy integration into large workflows. These new developments should help with the integration of landscape analysis in ecological research, given that ecologists are increasingly using R for the statistical analysis, modelling and visualization of spatial data},

  abstract = {Appropriate silviculture, based on natural forest dynamics and ecological attributes of tree species, is fundamental to the sustainable management of native (natural and semi-natural) forests for wood production. Continuous-cover silviculture works well in shade-tolerant spruce-fir-beech forests of Central Europe (in this paper, we use the German state of Bavaria as a typical example) and can be regarded as `close-to-nature', particularly where there is a focus on maintaining some old-growth elements for long-term retention. Continuous-cover silviculture, however, cannot be regarded as `close-to-nature' for Australian wet eucalypt forests, which are dominated by shade-intolerant eucalypts that are dependent on intensive disturbance, usually associated with fires, for their regeneration. While the prevailing technique of clearfelling, burning and sowing of eucalypt seed has some affinities with natural regeneration processes stimulated by bushfires, it differs substantially from natural disturbances in that it is more uniform than bushfires and removes most `legacy' structures such as live and dead trees, which are important to maintain some continuity of ecosystem functioning between forest generations. Variable retention silviculture, which retains mature stand elements for incorporation in the new stand, better approximates `close-to-nature' silviculture for wet eucalypt forests. Silvicultural trials and recent operational experience show that variable retention can be applied successfully in wet eucalypt forests in some situations. Although Tasmania has much higher levels of formal ecological reserves than Bavaria (49\% compared to just 3\%), its use of native forests, particularly wet eucalypt forests, for wood production struggles for acceptance by the general public. We suggest that high levels of social acceptance of forestry in Bavaria, and low levels in Tasmania, cannot be explained purely by ecological and silvicultural differences of the forest types. Other influential factors in Bavaria compared with Tasmania include higher levels of private forest ownership, practical forest knowledge, domestic processing, established forest road networks and profitability.},

Background and Objectives: To compare bird species richness and assemblage in tropical dry forests (TDFs) of different ages of recovery from cattle ranching and relate both to forest structural characteristics. Materials and Methods: To sample bird species richness and assemblage in 16 successional forest of different ages (i.e., 20, 30, 40, and 60 years old) using autonomous sound recording units in the TDFs in Costa Rica. Results: A total of 64 species of birds was detected across all forest age classes. The highest species richness was found in the 20-year-old class. Species richness decreased as canopy openness increased, suggesting low forest structural complexity and low availability of perches, nesting sites and food sources. However, bird assemblages were similar among the different forest age classes, suggesting that age itself was not a strong predictor, likely because of high variation in structure within age classes. Conclusions: TDFs can recover structural characteristics important to birds in only a few decades, supporting a rapid bird species assemblage recovery. However, this seems to depend on the starting conditions of the site prior to being recovered. Young TDFs, 20 years old, provide similar habitats for birds as 60-year-old forests do. These findings provide relevant information on the influence of TDF recovery after severe human impact on a highly threatened ecosystem.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Structure is a fundamental physical element of habitat, particularly in woodlands, and hence there has been considerable recent uptake of airborne lidar data in forest ecology studies. This paper investigates the significance of lidar data characteristics when modelling organism-habitat relationships, taking a single species case study in a mature woodland ecosystem. We re-investigate work on great tit (Parus major) habitat, focussing on bird breeding data from 1997 and 2001 (years with contrasting weather conditions and a demonstrated relationship between breeding success and forest structure). We use a time series of three lidar data acquisitions across a 12-year period (2000-2012). The lidar data characteristics assessed include time-lag with field data (up to 15 years), spatial sampling density (average post spacing in the range of 1 pulse per 0.14 m\textsuperscript{2-}17.77 m\textsuperscript{2}), approach to processing (raster or point cloud), and the complexity of derived structure metrics (with a total of 33 metrics assessed, each generated separately using all returns and only first returns). Ordinary least squares regression analysis was employed to investigate relationships between great tit mean nestling body mass, calculated per brood, and the various canopy structure measures from all lidar datasets. For the 2001 bird breeding data, the relationship between mean nestling body mass and mean canopy height for a sample area around each nest was robust to the extent that it could be detected strongly and with a high level of statistical significance, with relatively little impact of lidar data characteristics. In 1997, all relationships between lidar structure metrics and mean nestling body mass were weaker than in 2001 and more sensitive to lidar data characteristics, and in almost all cases they were opposite in trend. However, whilst the optimum habitat structure differed between the two study years, the lidar-derived metrics that best characterised this structure were consistent: canopy height percentiles and mean overstorey canopy height (calculated using all returns or only first returns) and the standard deviation of canopy height (calculated using all returns). Overall, our results suggest that for relatively stable woodland habitats, ecologists should not feel prohibited in using lidar data to explore or monitor organism-habitat relationships because of perceived data quality issues, as long as the questions investigated, the scale of analysis, and the interpretation of findings are appropriate for the data available.},

The woodland is ancient, semi-natural broadleaf and has a heterogeneous structure with a mostly closed canopy overstorey and a patchy understorey layer. In this study, the understorey was defined as suppressed trees and shrubs growing beneath an overstorey canopy. Forest mensuration data for the study site were examined to identify thresholds (taking the 95th percentile) for crown depth as a percentage of crown top height for the six overstorey tree species present. These data were used in association with a digital tree species map and leaf-on first return LiDAR data, to identify the possible depth of space available below the overstorey canopy in which an understorey layer could exist. The leaf-off last return LiDAR data were then examined to identify whether they contained information on where this space was occupied by suppressed trees or shrubs forming an understorey. Thus, understorey was mapped from the leaf-off last return data where the height was below the predicted crown depth. A height threshold of 1 m was applied to separate the ground vegetation layer from the understorey. The derived understorey model formed a discontinuous layer covering 46.4 ha (or 31\% of the study site), with an average height of 2.64 m and a 77\% correspondence with field data on the presence/absence of suppressed trees and shrubs (kappa 0.53). Because the first return data in leaf-on and leaf-off conditions were very similar (differing by an average of just 0.87 m), it was also possible to map the understorey layer using leaf-off data alone. The resultant understorey model covered 39.4 ha (or 26\% of the study site), and had a 72\% correspondence with field data on the presence/absence of suppressed trees and shrubs (kappa 0.45). This moderate reduction in the area of understorey mapped and associated accuracy came with a saving of half of all data acquisition and pre-processing costs. Whilst the understorey modelling presented here undoubtedly benefited from the specific timing of LiDAR data acquisition and from ancillary data available for the study site, the conclusions have resonance beyond this case study. Given that the understorey and overstorey canopies in lowland broadleaf woodland can merge into one another, the modelling of understorey information from discrete-return LiDAR data must consider overstorey canopy characteristics and laser penetration through the overstorey. It is not adequate in such circumstances to apply simple height thresholds to LiDAR height frequency distributions, as this is unlikely to distinguish whether a return has backscattered from the lower parts of the overstorey canopy or from near the surface of the understorey canopy.

  abstract = {Many species of birds are adversely affected by clearcutting of Australian eucalypt forests for timber. However, recolonisation of harvested areas may be enhanced if mature forest is retained nearby (forest influence). We test the benefits of proximity to mature Tasmanian wet eucalypt forest on birds in adjacent regenerating clearcuts. We hypothesised that bird assemblages in silvicultural regeneration would become more similar to those in adjacent mature forest with increasing proximity to the mature forest. To test this, we sampled birds in regenerating clearcuts using 25 m radius point counts centred 35, 120, and 200 m from mature forest. We also hypothesised that the magnitude of forest influence would decrease with time since harvest, across three age classes of approximately 7, 27 and 45 years-old, because the assemblages in older regeneration would be more similar to those in the mature forest. We found that distance from mature forest had no significant effects on bird assemblage composition, native species richness per sample, or the incidences of any species. This result was apparent across all three age classes of silvicultural regeneration, despite significant changes in the assemblage composition, native species richness, and incidence of 10 species, with time since harvest.

  abstract = {Modern advances in cloud computing and machine-leaning algorithms are shifting the manner in which Earth-observation (EO) data are used for environmental monitoring, particularly as we settle into the era of free, open-access satellite data streams. Wetland delineation represents a particularly worthy application of this emerging research trend, since wetlands are an ecologically important yet chronically under-represented component of contemporary mapping and monitoring programs, particularly at the regional and national levels. Exploiting Google Earth Engine and R Statistical software, we developed a workflow for predicting the probability of wetland occurrence using a boosted regression tree machine-learning framework applied to digital topographic and EO data. Working in a 13,700 km2 study area in northern Alberta, our best models produced excellent results, with AUC (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve) values of 0.898 and explained-deviance values of 0.708. Our results demonstrate the central role of high-quality topographic variables for modeling wetland distribution at regional scales. Including optical and/or radar variables into the workflow substantially improved model performance, though optical data performed slightly better. Converting our wetland probability-of-occurrence model into a binary Wet-Dry classification yielded an overall accuracy of 85\%, which is virtually identical to that derived from the Alberta MergedWetland Inventory (AMWI): the contemporary inventory used by the Government of Alberta. However, our workflow contains several key advantages over that used to produce the AMWI, and provides a scalable foundation for province-wide monitoring initiatives.},

  abstract = {Fire plays a prominent role in many biomes, but the natural fire regime has been influenced by silvicultural management, changes in land use, climate changes, and fire suppression. Fire clearly induces profound changes in both habitat characteristics and assemblages of saproxylic insects. However, our current understanding on this is strongly biased toward coniferous boreal and temperate systems and specific taxonomic groups, e.g., beetles, whereas the information from other biomes and saproxylic groups is limited at best. Knowledge from coniferous boreal and temporal systems might not be applicable in other biomes; therefore, studies in those areas should have high priority. Although natural fire regimes vary among ecosystems, saproxylic insects adapted to fire, both with respect to physiology and behavior, can be found in many different ecosystems. Changes in fire regimes can therefore have strong effects on saproxylic species, especially specialist pyrophilous species. For example, disruption of fire regimes in the boreal region, due to silvicultural management, changes in land use, and fire suppression, is a serious threat to saproxylic species, and restoring natural fire regimes is of the essence. Fire has been used as an active management tool to benefit saproxylic species in Fennoscandia. However, the effects of fire on saproxylic species are rather short-lived which should be considered in landscape planning. It has also been suggested that some fire-adapted species must be able to maintain viable populations in the unburned forest matrix if it is of sufficient quality. Thus, our ability to maintain viable populations of pyrophilous and fire-favored saproxylic species might depend on the sum of all conservation efforts on the landscape level rather than fire restoration efforts alone.},

Here we use 13 years of data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to bin individual MODIS pixels (5.3 ha) into phenoclasses, where each phenoclass consists of pixels with a particular temporal profile of NDVI, regardless of spatial location. We present novel procedures that assign sites to phenoclusters, defined as particular composition of phenoclasses within a 1 km radius. We apply these procedures to Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidenralis lucida) nesting locations in the Sacramento Mountain range in south-central New Mexico. Phenoclasses at owl nest sites and phenoclusters around owl nest sites differed from those at and around points randomly placed in forest types that are known to support nesting owls. Stand exam data showed that the phenoclasses associated with owl nest sites are dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and white fir (Abies concolor). The availability of phenoclusters and phenoclasses on Mescalero Apache tribal lands differed from those on adjacent National Forest lands within the Sacramento Mountain, consistent with different elevations and forest management practices. Nonetheless owls predominately used the same phenoclasses and phenoclusters in both land ownerships. MODIS phenoclasses and phenoclusters offer a useful means of remotely identifying forest conditions suitable for wildlife. Because the remote sensing data are freely available and regularly updated, they can be part of a cost effective approach to monitor and assess forested wildlife habitat over large temporal and spatial scales.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more likely to conserve biodi-versity. We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old ({$>$}120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having -95\% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6\% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Spe-cies Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that dif-fered between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities oc-curred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities oc-curred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with 1-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), to-gether with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were ap-parent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has im-portant consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on postharvest stands. Lin-coln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Red-start (Setophaga ruticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.},

We apply UAV technology to wildlife monitoring in tropical and polar environments and demonstrate that UAV-derived counts of colony nesting birds are an order of magnitude more precise than traditional ground counts. The increased count precision afforded by UAVs, along with their ability to survey hard-to-reach populations and places, will likely drive many wildlife monitoring projects that rely on population counts to transition from traditional methods to UAV technology. Careful consideration will be required to ensure the coherence of historic data sets with new UAV-derived data and we propose a method for determining the number of duplicated (concurrent UAV and ground counts) sampling points needed to achieve data compatibility.},

Red-naped sapsucker ecology within aspen (Populus tremuloides) has been well studied, but relatively little is known about red-naped sapsuckers in conifer for- ests. We used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to examine occupancy patterns of red-naped sapsuckers in a conifer-dominated system. We surveyed for sapsuckers at 162 sites in northern Idaho, USA, during 2009 and 2010. We used occupancy models and an information-theoretic approach to model sap- sucker occupancy as a function of four LiDAR-based metrics that characterized vegetation structure and tree harvest, and one non-LiDAR metric that charac- terized distance to major roads. We evaluated model support across a range of territory sizes using Akaike's information criterion. Top model support was highest at the 4-ha extent, which suggested that 4 ha was the most relevant scale describing sapsucker occupancy. Sapsuckers were positively associated with variation of canopy height and harvested area, and negatively associated with shrub and large tree density. These results suggest that harvest regimes and structural diversity of vegetation at moderate extents (e.g., 4 ha) largely influ- ence occurrence of red-naped sapsuckers in conifer forests. Given the current and projected declines of aspen populations, it will be increasingly important to assess habitat relationships, as well as demographic characteristics, of aspen- associated species such as red-naped sapsuckers within conifer-dominated sys- tems},

  abstract = {1. The increasing availability of high resolution and high frequency, radar-based remote sensing data (i.e. observations on land surface characteristics, insensitive to cloud interference), makes it possible to track land-use intensity more precisely at the whole landscape scale. 2. Here, we develop a new radar-based remote sensing technique for large-scale quantification of agricultural land-use intensity across human-dominated landscapes. We compare the respective abilities of Sentinel-1 C-band radar (C-SAR, C-band synthetic aperture radar) remote sensing data with the more traditional optical data, as MODIS enhanced vegetation indices (MODIS EVI), in capturing seasonality and the magnitude of land-use intensity (quantity and frequency of biomass removal). Linking our novel radar-based change detection algorithm to agricultural management activities on the ground, we quantify a whole landscape according to timing of mowing, a key grassland disturbance, thus capturing the dynamics of mowing regimes in grasslands. 3. We found that the radar-based proxy provides a rapid and reliable measure of land-use intensity, reliably predicting plant community composition at the landscape scale. 4. We tested this methodology using data on black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa limosa), a specialist breeder of lowland meadows which, over the last 50years, has shown dramatic declines. During territory establishment, black-tailed godwits preferentially used fields corresponding to intermediate radar-sensed land-use intensities. However, the present-day timing of mowing in these habitats was such that most godwit broods were less likely to be successful than broods in grasslands used at a lower intensity. 5. Synthesis and applications. The newly developed radar-based land-use intensity quantification is a powerful tool that makes it possible for ecologists and land managers to include agricultural land-use intensity measurements in population studies of the plants, insects, birds and mammals using these landscapes, at the spatial scale of entire populations. Applications of this tool include evaluating the effectiveness of European agri-environment schemes aiming to increase biodiversity through decreased land-use intensity or expanding the quantification of agricultural land-use intensity to other geographic regions.},

  abstract = {Avian diversity is under increasing pressures. It is thus critical to understand the ecological variables that contribute to large scale spatial distribution of avian species diversity. Traditionally, studies have relied primarily on two-dimensional habitat structure to model broad scale species richness. Vegetation vertical structure is increasingly used at local scales. However, the spatial arrangement of vegetation height has never been taken into consideration. Our goal was to examine the efficacies of three-dimensional forest structure, particularly the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation height in improving avian richness models across forested ecoregions in the U.S. We developed novel habitat metrics to characterize the spatial arrangement of vegetation height using the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset for the year 2000 (NBCD). The height-structured metrics were compared with other habitat metrics for statistical association with richness of three forest breeding bird guilds across Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes: a broadly grouped woodland guild, and two forest breeding guilds with preferences for forest edge and for interior forest. Parametric and non-parametric models were built to examine the improvement of predictability. Height-structured metrics had the strongest associations with species richness, yielding improved predictive ability for the woodland guild richness models (r2 = {$\sim$}0.53 for the parametric models, 0.63 the non-parametric models) and the forest edge guild models (r2 = {$\sim$}0.34 for the parametric models, 0.47 the non-parametric models). All but one of the linear models incorporating height-structured metrics showed significantly higher adjusted-r2 values than their counterparts without additional metrics. The interior forest guild richness showed a consistent low association with height-structured metrics. Our results suggest that height heterogeneity, beyond canopy height alone, supplements habitat characterization and richness models of forest bird species. The metrics and models derived in this study demonstrate practical examples of utilizing three-dimensional vegetation data for improved characterization of spatial patterns in species richness.},

  abstract = {The study of population dynamics and species\textendash habitat interactions is important for many ecological and conservation issues. We analysed the occupancy dynamics of the Wood Warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, a forest interior passerine that has suffered long-term declines in many European countries. Considering a broad range of habitat descriptors, including LiDAR-based variables characterizing forest structure, we identified environmental factors influencing the probabilities of occupancy, colonization, extinction and detection, and mapped these probabilities at a landscape scale. We used presence\textendash absence data collected between 1999 and 2013 in a robust-design protocol with replicated surveys within each primary sampling season (i.e. breeding season). To analyse occupancy dynamics, we fitted dynamic occupancy models with covariates describing topography, forest extent and structure, soil, seed masting (as a proxy for rodent abundance) and weather conditions during settlement. Initial occupancy was positively related to slope, forest cover and the proportion of broadleaf forest, and negatively related to forest edge length, canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Colonization probability was positively associated with slope and negatively with canopy height variation and soil nutrients. Extinction probability was negatively related to slope, positively related to forest edge length and was lowest at intermediate vegetation heights. Detection probability decreased during the season and was positively related to forest cover. This study provides insights into the settlement dynamics of a declining forest species by identifying potential drivers of the processes underlying occupancy dynamics, instead of simply modelling species abundance or occurrence. Forest-related covariates were of overwhelming importance for the settlement dynamics of the Wood Warbler. Conservation measures should focus on providing and maintaining the species' preferred forest structure, specifically in extended forests. In Switzerland, forests located on slopes and on nutrient-poor soils should be prioritized for conservation. Finally, comparing findings derived from the relatively coarse scale of this study with those from the small scale of individual territories suggests that conservation recommendations deduced from large-scale monitoring schemes alone may be incomplete, and vice versa.},

An optimal strategy for mapping forest structure would include detailed measurements of the vertical dimension, which are traditionally provided by field sampling, together with the broad spatial coverage afforded by remote sensing. While no single sensor is capable of delivering this at the present time, it should be possible to combine information from multiple sensors to achieve a reasonable approximation. In this study, we compare estimates of forest structural metrics derived from remote sensing to measurements obtained in the field (large tree maximum canopy height, mean canopy height, standard deviation canopy height, and biomass). We then statistically combine structural information from LiDAR, RaDAR, and passive optical sensors in an attempt to improve accuracy of our estimates. The results of this study indicate that LiDAR is the best single sensor for estimating canopy height and biomass. The addition of ETM+ metrics significantly improved LiDAR estimates of large tree structure, while Quickbird and InSAR/SAR improved estimates either marginally or not at all. The combination of all sensors was more accurate than LiDAR alone, but only marginally better than the combination of LiDAR and ETM+. Structure metrics from LiDAR and RaDAR are essentially redundant, as are ETM+ and Quickbird.},

Investigating how historically retained trees function as biological legacies could help predict the long-term ecological potential of current retention practices. Here, we investigated whether large, retained trees of Cryptomeria japonica D. Don ({$>$} 1000 years old) functioned as refugia for persistence of canopy woody plants after logging in a 350-year-old secondary forest in Yakushima, southern Japan. We climbed five each of retained and regenerated trees in a 1-ha research plot, measured trunk and crown structures, and tagged and measured every woody plant stem found on each tree. Compared to regenerated trees, retained trees had twice the surface area available for canopy plant colonization. Moreover, retained trees hosted disproportionately greater abundance of canopy woody plants. Together, the five retained trees hosted 22 species of woody plants comprising 1188 individuals, whereas regenerated trees hosted only 8 species (37 individuals). Combined with our ground-based measurement, canopy woody species contributed 16\% of all woody plant species in the plot. Among the five retained trees, woody plant abundance increased markedly with increasing age of trunk breaks. This was because numerous epicormic branches had sprouted below trunk breaks creating large surface area upon which arboreal soil accumulated and woody plants established. Canopy woody plants on retained trees showed wide vertical distribution corresponding to complex crown structure, whereas those on regenerated trees occurred almost exclusively on the lower trunk. Maximum stem size of canopy woody plants was constrained by the volume of arboreal soil upon which they grew. Based on their size structures, we inferred that three species endemic to Yakushima (Vacciniwn yakushimense Makino., Viburnum urceolatwn Sieb. et Zucc., and Rhododendron yakushimanum Nakai), maintain stable populations in the retained trees by sprouting. Several other species scarcely found on the ground were also regenerating in the canopy. Our results demonstrate that retained trees of Cryptomeria functioned as refugia allowing canopy woody plants to persist after logging and give support to the importance of conserving large trees for enhancing biodiversity in forests where canopy plants contribute to species diversity.},

We also sampled never cut stands within each successional stage. The ten most abundant species made up ca. 95\% of the 32 976 individuals collected. Two species were distributed across all successional cover-types, and the remaining eight species were restricted to either early- or late-successional forests. Five species (Calathus ingratus, Platynus decentis, Stereocerus haematopus, Agonum retractum and Calathus advena) responded negatively to forest harvest, and their population sizes dropped below detection in many of the higher-intensity harvest treatments. However, responses to harvest vary with species and, thus, the overall consequences for carabid assemblages will likely depend on the mix of species involved.},

We examined the effects of variable retention harvesting on saproxylic beetle assemblages. Variable retention of living green trees seeks to leave more forest structure on the landscape with the goal of maintaining ecosystem function and biodiversity. Ninety flight-intercept traps were divided between recently dead natural snags and snags killed by girdling in three replicated forest stands with 10\%, 20\%, 50\%, and 75\% residual structure and in uncut control stands. Beetles were collected and identified during the second and third summers post harvest and grouped for analyses as (i) wood- and bark-borers, (ii) fungivores, and (iii) predators. Harvesting intensity explained a relatively small amount of the variability in the beetle assemblages. However, all groups responded strongly to coarse woody debris variables and especially to snag decay class during the third postharvest summer, suggesting that factors associated with coarse woody debris quality and quantity determine the initial responses and successional trajectories of saproxylic beetle assemblages. The main effects of variable retention on saproxylic assemblages are expected to be mediated through differences in amount of coarse woody debris expected to materialize with the death and decay of green trees left as residual elements.},

The different prescriptions are aimed to emulate natural disturbance, encourage regeneration (seed trees), or offer other ecosystem services, such as the maintenance of local biodiversity or habitat features. Using remotely sensed data, stand-replacing disturbance associated with clearcutting is commonly accurately detected. Novel time series-based change detection products offer an opportunity to determine the capacity to detect and label a wider range of harvest practices. In this research, we demonstrate the capacity of time series imagery, spectral metrics, and related attributed change products, to distinguish between different harvesting practices over a study area in central British Columbia, Canada. Producer's accuracy of harvest attribution was 79\%, with 93\% of harvest blocks {$>$}5 ha accurately identified. In relation to the amount of canopy cover removed, clearcut harvesting was the most accurately classified (84\%), followed by clearcut with residual (79\%), and partial cut (64\%). Applying detailed spectral metrics derived from Landsat data revealed clearcut and partial cuts to be spectrally distinct. The annual nature of the Landsat time series also offers spatial harvest information within typical, often decadal, forest inventory update cycles. The statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.05) relationship between harvest practices and Landsat spectral information indicates a capacity to add increased attribution richness to remote sensing depictions of forest harvest.},

In birds, despite recent advances in tracking techniques, knowledge of habitat needs remains incomplete for most species. Using radio telemetry, we quantified the relative space use of 37 Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) males, captured over 2 years (2013, 2014) on their breeding grounds in coastal Virginia. Following tracking, we collected data on prey availability (n = 370 plots) and habitat structure (n = 222 plots) within bird home ranges, and modeled bird utilization distribution with both sets of variables using mixed models. Our objectives were to (a) determine the relative importance of habitat structure and prey availability for bird use, (b) identify specific resources that related to bird utilization distribution, (c) test the hypothesis that soil moisture explained prey availability, and (d) evaluate models by determining whether model-identified conditions agreed with data at sites where Wood Thrushes were absent over the preceding 5 years. Of prey variables, high-use areas within bird home ranges were linked to higher biomass of spiders and worm-like invertebrates, which were strongly correlated with soil moisture. Of habitat structure variables, bird use related negatively to red oak (Quercus spp.) count and pine (Pinus spp.) basal area, and positively to forest canopy height, snag basal area, and number and species richness of trees, among others. Evaluation of 12 covariates in our best model revealed that 5 were significant, with conditions at bird absence sites congruent with our models. Goodness-of-fit tests revealed poor fit of the prey-only model, whereas the habitat-only model explained nearly 8 times the variation in bird use. The model utilizing both prey and structure covariates yielded only marginal improvement over the habitat-only model. Consequently, management objectives aimed at habitat improvement for the declining Wood Thrush should particularly consider habitat structure resources.},

  abstract = {Negative impacts of forestry on biodiversity have been addressed through environmental considerations held within legislation and various forest certification protocols. We used Sweden as a case study where a long history of forestry aiming at sustained yield of wood fiber has resulted in landscapes with low quantities of old growth structures e.g. dead wood and old forest, but where environmental considerations have been implemented during the last two decades. We reviewed the scientific literature for studies evaluating the environmental considerations included in the Swedish Forestry Act and FSC, compared individual metrics and benchmarks, identified thresholds as well as identified specific gaps missing from current regulations (missing factors/areas of improvement). All environmental considerations listed in the Swedish Forestry Act were found to be relevant for conservation. The strongest scientific support for their importance in maintaining biodiversity in managed landscapes was found for dead wood, tree retention and habitats for sensitive species, including edge zones and woodland key habitats. However, suggested levels fall below identified thresholds. Retention of small habitat patches can provide a life-boat function for some red-listed species, but the long term survival of these populations is uncertain. Tree species composition was also found be important, and in the boreal region the proportion of deciduous trees is a key factor. For some environmental considerations, there is too limited information from the scientific literature to evaluate their importance in relation to the current levels, e.g. consequences of clear-cut size and shape, and forest roads. Similarly, damage to soil and water affect biodiversity through drainage, leakage and sedimentation, but the effects vary considerably and are often diffuse. There is a need to better adjust the levels of environmental considerations above thresholds from empirical studies. However, it will be impossible within current regulatory framework to maintain all species in all landscapes. Therefore, the allocation of environmental consideration among stands, landscapes and regions need to be considered. Evenly dispersed retention might always stay below suggested thresholds with limited contribution to ecologically sustainable forest ecosystems. More flexibility, where the sum of conservation measures in the landscape as opposed to measures in individual stands are considered, would result in better conservation strategies. This would mean that particular landscapes could be more intensively managed and in other more focus on biodiversity conservation could be taken. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Increasingly, conservation professionals and regulatory agencies are attempting to identify ecological thresholds that define a point at which populations or communities demonstrate a marked response to human disturbance. Such thresholds may serve as the foundation for recognizing and then imposing limits on the levels of disturbance or types of land use. Although an intuitive concept, I argue that there are numerous scientific and practical limitations to applying ecological thresholds to conservation deci-sion making. First, the concept is limited by the lack of a clear and universally accepted definition. Often, a threshold is defined as the point at which a population demonstrates a nonlinear ecological or biological response to some critical level of disturbance. Alternative definitions are premised on different trajecto-ries of response or a direct recognition of conservation risks when prioritising socioeconomic values. Sec-ond, there is no clear or consistent method for identifying ecological thresholds including the appropriate response variables. Third, there is little evidence to suggest that ecological thresholds generalize to other species or populations; this limits the efficiency of thresholds as a decision making tool. Fourth, even where ecological thresholds are identified for the purpose of regulation or conservation planning, there are few examples of effective implementation. In comparison, regulatory limits are premised on the eco-logical response of populations to disturbance, but also consider the socioeconomic realities of conserva-tion decision making including the risk associated with greater levels of development. Limits can be identified through participatory decision making processes that allow a consideration of potential future conditions within the context of current ecological and economic circumstances. When followed with long-term monitoring, regulatory limits can improve existing or provide new avenues for conservation planning and regulation.},

The . Abstract . Since its development , occupancy modeling has become a popular and useful tool for ecologists wishing to learn about the dynamics of species occurrence over time and space . Such models require presence \textendash{} absence data to be collected at spatially indexed survey units . However , only recently have researchers recognized the need to correct for spatially induced overdisperison by explicitly accounting for spatial autocorrelation in occupancy probability . Previous efforts to incorporate such autocorrelation have largely focused on logit - normal formulations for occupancy , with spatial autocorrelation induced by a random effect within a hierarchical modeling framework . Although useful , computational time generally limits such an approach to relatively small data sets , and there are often problems with algorithm instability , yielding unsatisfactory results . Further , recent research has revealed a hidden form of multicollinearity in such applications , which may lead to parameter bias if not explicitly addressed . Combining several techniques , we present a unifying hierarchical spatial occupancy model specification that is particularly effective over large spatial extents . This approach employs a probit mixture framework for occupancy and can easily accommodate a reduced - dimensional spatial process to resolve issues with multicollinearity and spatial confounding while improving algorithm convergence . Using open - source software , we demonstrate this new model specification using a case study involving occupancy of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) over a set of 1080 survey units spanning a large contiguous region (108 000 km 2) in northern Ontario , Canada . Overall , the combination of a more efficient specification and open - source software allows for a facile and stable implementation of spatial occupancy models for large data sets .},

  abstract = {Several new forestry practices directed at mitigating the influence of clear-cutting on biodiversity and other ecosystem properties have been launched recently. Retention forestry is the most widespread of these practices, but so far most studies have evaluated effects of retention levels that are higher than commonly applied by forestry in many parts of the world. Furthermore possible interaction effects between retaining forest structures and other common forestry practices, such as prescribed burning are still largely unexplored. Here we present results from a ten year stand-level factorial forestry experiment in Eastern Finland (FIRE1) with retention levels full (100\%), elevated (50 m(3)/ha), low (10 m(3)/ha) and no retention (0\%) combined with or without prescribed burning. We show that neither low, nor elevated retention is sufficient to influence the vegetation composition, or dynamic relative to no retention in unburned sites at stand level. However, retention in combination with prescribed burning influenced post-harvest community composition, so that species composition of the elevated retention treatment differed from low- and no retention treatments. When prescribed burning was applied, the functionally important species Vaccinium vitis-idaea had two times higher cover in stands with elevated retention compared to stands with low or no retention. We conclude that at the stand level, low retention levels do not mitigate clear-cut induced disturbance and retention can neither preserve the pre-harvest vegetation nor change the post-harvest vegetational dynamic.

  abstract = {Habitat loss and climate change are major processes affecting biodiversity, especially in the Arctic which is experiencing rapid sea ice decline. Loss of sea ice habitat for ice-dependent species such as polar bears (Ursus maritimus) has been associated with declines in body condition, reproductive output, survival, and abundance. Monitoring habitat use can therefore provide insights into population responses to sea ice loss, especially for vulnerable demographic groups such as subadults. Here, we used resource selection functions to examine habitat selection patterns of subadult male and female (n = 21) and adult female (n = 37) polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea population from 2007 to 2011. We found that polar bears displayed broad similarities in seasonal habitat selection by using nearshore areas in winter/spring and ranging farther offshore into the multiyear ice in summer/autumn. However, there were differences in habitat use among age, sex, and reproductive classes. Adult females with cubs-of-the-year differed the most among classes and selected landfast ice in spring, allowing them to hunt for seal birth lairs while reducing risk of intra-specific predation. Adult females with older cubs and solitary adult females used active sea ice, which allowed them to hunt adult seals, while subadult females used a mix of active and landfast ice. Subadult males had similar selection for landfast ice as females with cubs-of-the-year, potentially as a mechanism to reduce intra-specific competition and/or kleptoparasitism. The Arctic faces continued warming and understanding variation in habitat use patterns can assist in identifying which bears are most vulnerable to loss of different sea ice habitats.},

Do the effects from the time since clear-cutting differ between forest and grassland plant species? LocationProvince of ostergotland, southern Sweden. MethodsTwelve contemporary clear-cut areas that were once meadows and 12 that were once forests were selected using land-use maps from the 1870s. Grasses and herbaceous plants were surveyed twice, once in 2009 and once in 2013 (2-4 and 6-8yrs after clear-cutting, respectively). Plant presence was recorded within 100 circular sample plots (radius 1m) placed evenly throughout each respective clear-cut area along transects spaced 25-m apart. The number of sample plots in which a species was present was taken as a measure of that species' frequency. Random effects meta-analysis, odds ratios and ANCOVA were used to analyse species responses to clear-cutting over time. ResultsA total of 170 plant species were found in the study, of which 33 were classified as grassland indicator species and 31 as plants primarily confined to forests. Clear-cut areas with a history as meadowland had, on average, up to 64\% higher total species richness and 110\% more grassland indicator species than did clear-cut areas with a history as forest. The time since clear-cutting had no effect on total species richness. However, the odds of finding a grassland indicator species decreased with the time since clear-cutting, whereas the odds of finding a forest species increased. ConclusionsWe concluded that land-use history plays an important role in explaining the flora found in Swedish clear-cuts, and that its effects on species richness remain for a minimum of 8yrs after harvest (conservative estimate). This phenomenon highlights the importance of acknowledging land-use legacies in ecological research and conservation. Future studies should investigate various options for the promotion of grassland plants in clear-cuts with a history of grassland management while also acknowledging the potential conflicts between conservation and production. The results may pertain to other countries with similar land-use histories.},

Although numerous metrics can be derived from light detection and ranging, three suites common to the literature include height percentiles, canopy height descriptors and canopy volume profiles. This study assessed these three metric types for differenti-ating among vegetation structural classes in the Southern Gulf Islands, Sidney, BC, Canada.

Contrary to our expectations, only 50 studies specifically addressed land use, and five assessed land use changes, while the majority addressed land cover.

We sampled 94 primary and secondary sites (19-93,223-350, and 600 years old) from three conifer forest zones in western Washington state, USA, in the field and with small-footprint, discrete return LiDAR. Seven sets of LiDAR metrics were tested to measure canopy structure. Ordinations using the of LiDAR 95th percentile height, rumple, and canopy density metrics had the strongest correlations with ordinations using two sets of field metrics (Procrustes R = 0.72 and 0.78) and a combined ser of LiDAR and field metrics (Procrustes R = 0.95). These results suggest that LiDAR can accurately characterize forest successional stage where field measurements are not available. This has important implications for enabling basic and applied studies of forest structure at stand to landscape scales.},

We estimated severity for fires from 1984 to 2010 using the Landsat-derived Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) and measured openings and canopy clumps in five height strata using airborne LiDAR data. Because our study area lacked concurrent field data, we identified methods to allow structural analysis using LiDAR data alone. We found three spatial structures, canopy-gap, clump-open, and open, that differed in spatial arrangement and proportion of canopy and openings. As fire severity increased, the total area in canopy decreased while the number of clumps increased, creating a patchwork of openings and multistory tree clumps. The presence of openings {$>$}. 0.3. ha, an approximate minimum gap size needed to favor shade-intolerant pine regeneration, increased rapidly with loss of canopy area. The range and variation of structures for a given fire severity were specific to each forest type. Low- to moderate-severity fires best replicated the historic clump-opening patterns that were common in forests with frequent fire regimes. Our results suggest that managers consider the following goals for their forest restoration: 1) reduce total canopy cover by breaking up large contiguous areas into variable-sized tree clumps and scattered large individual trees; 2) create a range of opening sizes and shapes, including \textasciitilde. 50\% of the open area in gaps {$>$}. 0.3. ha; 3) create multistory clumps in addition to single story clumps; 4) retain historic densities of large trees; and 5) vary treatments to include canopy-gap, clump-open, and open mosaics across project areas to mimic the range of patterns found for each forest type in our study. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The analyses we discuss here focus on the geographic scale (Lord and Norton. 1990) and are concerned with the fragmented pattern of old-growth forests that results from timber harvest. In the case of the northern spotted owl, concerns over the fragmentation of habitat have been translated into a specific plan for the owl's conservation (Thomas et al., 1990). In this chapter we report some of the models that were used to guide decisions and thinking about the size and geometry of the habitat reserves that form the core of this conservation plan.

The objectives of the study were to identify the variables driving the year-to-year vegetation dynamics in three regional landscapes (desert, steppe, and mountainous); and to determine if the identified environmental drivers can be used to explain the spatial-temporal variability of these spatio-temporal dynamics over time. It was posed that patterns of change in terrestrial phenology, derived from the 8 km bi-weekly time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data acquired by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellites (1981-2008), can be explained through a multi-scale analysis of a suite of environmental drivers. Multiple linear stepwise regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses and address the objectives of the study. The annually computed phenological response variables or pheno-metricstime (season start, season length, and an NDVI-based productivity metric) were modeled as a function of ten environmental factors relating to soil, topography, and climate. Each of the three studied regional landscapes was shown to be governed by a distinctive suite of environmental drivers. The phenological responses of the steppe landscapes were affected by the year-to-year variation in temperature regimes. The phenology of the mountainous landscapes was influenced primarily by the elevation gradient. The phenological responses of desert landscapes were demonstrated to have the greatest variability over time and seemed to be affected by soil carbon content and year-to-year variation of both temperature regimes and winter precipitation patterns. Amounts and scales of observed phenological variability over time (measured through coefficient of variation for each pheno-metrictime) in each of the regional landscapes were interpreted in terms of their resistance and resilience capacities under existing and projected environmental settings. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the authors.},

They can be generated by exploiting the temporal and spectral reflectance properties of land surface components. Interannual and seasonal LSP data are important for understanding and predicting an ecosystem's response to variations caused by natural and anthropogenic drivers. This research examines spatio-temporal change patterns and interactions between terrestrial phenology and 28 years of climate dynamics in Central Asia. Long-term (1981-2008) LSP records such as timing of the start, peak and length of the growing season and vegetation productivity were derived from remotely sensed vegetation greenness data. The patterns were analyzed to identify and characterize the impact of climate drivers at regional scales. We explored the relationships between phenological and precipitation and temperature variables for three generalized land use types that were exposed to decadelong regional drought events and intensified land and water resource use: rainfed agriculture, irrigated agriculture, and non-agriculture. To determine whether and how LSP dynamics are associated with climate patterns, a series of simple linear regression analyses between these two variables was executed. The three land use classes showed unique phenological responses to climate variation across Central Asia. Most of the phenological response variables were shown to be positively correlated to precipitation and negatively correlated to temperature. The most substantial climate variable affecting phenological responses of all three land use classes was a spring temperature regime. These results indicate that future higher temperatures would cause earlier and longer growing seasons. \textcopyright{} 2012 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Results indicated that total forest area declined by 3\%, from 4128Mha in 1990 to 3999Mha in 2015. The annual rate of net forest loss halved from 7.3Mhay-1 in the 1990s to 3.3Mhay-1 between 2010 and 2015. Natural forest area declined from 3961Mha to 3721Mha between 1990 and 2015, while planted forest (including rubber plantations) increased from 168Mha to 278Mha. From 2010 to 2015, tropical forest area declined at a rate of 5.5Mhay-1 - only 58\% of the rate in the 1990s - while temperate forest area expanded at a rate of 2.2Mhay-1. Boreal and sub-tropical forest areas showed little net change. Forest area expanded in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, East Asia, and Western-Central Asia, but declined in Central America, South America, South and Southeast Asia and all three regions in Africa. Analysis indicates that, between 1990 and 2015, 13 tropical countries may have either passed through their forest transitions from net forest loss to net forest expansion, or continued along the path of forest expansion that follows these transitions. Comparing FRA 2015 statistics with the findings of global and pan-tropical remote-sensing forest area surveys was challenging, due to differences in assessment periods, the definitions of forest and remote sensing methods. More investment in national and global forest monitoring is needed to provide better support for international initiatives to increase sustainable forest management and reduce forest loss, particularly in tropical countries.},

Strong correspondence between charcoal-inferred and observational fire records shows the fidelity of sedimentary charcoal records as archives of past fire regimes. Fire frequency and area burned increased {$\sim$}6,000-3,000 y ago, probably as a result of elevated landscape flammability associated with increased Picea mariana in the regional vegetation. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; {$\sim$}1,000-500 cal B.P.), the period most similar to recent decades, warm and dry climatic conditions resulted in peak biomass burning, but severe fires favored less-flammable deciduous vegetation, such that fire frequency remained relatively stationary. These results suggest that boreal forests can sustain high-severity fire regimes for centuries under warm and dry conditions, with vegetation feedbacks modulating climate-fire linkages. The apparent limit to MCA burning has been surpassed by the regional fire regime of recent decades, which is characterized by exceptionally high fire frequency and biomass burning. This extreme combination suggests a transition to a unique regime of unprecedented fire activity. However, vegetation dynamics similar to feedbacks that occurred during the MCA may stabilize the fire regime, despite additional warming. paleoecology | Holocene | Arctic | climate change | climate-fire-vegetation interactions T he vast boreal forest biome is a crucial component of the Earth system, representing almost 10\% of the land surface and {$>$}30\% of terrestrial carbon stocks (1). Boreal ecosystems have undergone pronounced changes in recent decades in response to climatic warming (2), including increased forest burning, permafrost melting, and wetland drying. Changes in fire activity have gained special attention because of the potential for dramatic effects at multiple scales. Natural, stand-replacing wildfires are the principal disturbance in these ecosystems, and they release copious amounts of carbon directly through combustion of biomass and soil organic matter (3). Additionally, postfire succession occurs over many decades, with interacting effects on biogeochemical cycles (4), energy balance (5), and hydrology (6), all of which can produce climate feedbacks. Understanding these dynamics is essential to projecting future environmental change from local to global scales. The present understanding of boreal fire regimes is largely based on several decades of observational studies. Interannual variability in fire activity is related to seasonal climate (7, 8), and recent extreme fire years occurred under exceptionally warm and/or dry conditions (9). These relationships form the basis of various predictive models, which almost ubiquitously suggest increased frequency, size, and/or severity of burns in coming decades as a result of future warming (summarized in ref. 10). However, such projections often do not consider potentially important climate-fire-vegetation interactions. In particular, climate-driven increases in boreal forest burning may lead to the dominance of early successional deciduous vegetation and thereby produce a negative feedback to additional burning (9, 11). Because fire return intervals and successional cycles in the boreal forest occur over decadal to centennial timescales, the observational fire records of the past several decades are of limited use for understanding fire regime dynamics in these ecosystems. Paleoecological analysis is indispensable for elucidating the causes and consequences of ecosystem change over a broad range of environmental conditions and temporal scales. Here, we present results of charcoal analysis on sediment cores from 14 lakes in the Yukon Flats (YF) ecoregion of interior Alaska. We take advantage of the exceptionally high spatial density of our charcoal records to quantitatively evaluate the fidelity of sedi-mentary charcoal as a proxy indicator of past fire regimes. We then discuss variations in fire frequency, biomass burning, and fire severity in relation to climate and vegetation change at centennial to millennial timescales. These data allow us to put fire regime dynamics of the past several decades in the context of natural variability of past millennia and infer the role of climate-fire-vegetation interactions in boreal forest burning. We chose the YF ecoregion for this study because its recent fire frequencies are among the highest in the North American boreal forests (12, 13), corresponding to warm and dry summers in the region. Thus, this ecoregion is well-suited to serve as an upper bound on past and current burning in the boreal forest biome. Results and Discussion Validation and Interpretation of Charcoal Records. Charcoal analysis of lake sediments is widely used to quantify fire frequency and the relative amount of biomass burning through time (14, 15). Although this approach is generally supported theoretically (16) and empirically (17, 18), data remain limited for direct verification. Our study is particularly well-suited to address this limitation, as our sampling design provides unusually high spa-tiotemporal resolution (14 sites within an {$\sim$}1,000-km 2 region and median near-surface resolution of {$\sim$}5 y/sample). In addition, widespread recent burning in our study area ensures that ample fire data are available for comparison with the charcoal record, even in the short span of observational records [1950 CE (Com-mon Era) to present]. We capitalize on these characteristics to},

Here, we introduce LT for the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The GEE platform simplifies pre-processing steps, allowing focus on the translation of the core temporal segmentation algorithm. Temporal segmentation involved a series of repeated random access calls to each pixel's time series, resulting in a set of breakpoints ("vertices") that bound straight-line segments. The translation of the algorithm into GEE included both transliteration and code analysis, resulting in improvement and logic error fixes. At six study areas representing diverse land cover types across the U.S., we conducted a direct comparison of the new LT-GEE code against the heritage code (LT-IDL). The algorithms agreed in most cases, and where disagreements occurred, they were largely attributable to logic error fixes in the code translation process. The practical impact of these changes is minimal, as shown by an example of forest disturbance mapping. We conclude that the LT-GEE algorithm represents a faithful translation of the LT code into a platform easily accessible by the broader user community.},

  abstract = {We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. This concept requires both new algorithms to extract change and new interpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge is to resolve salient features of the time series while eliminating noise introduced by ephemeral changes in illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric registration. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create on-the-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections. No suitable reference data are available to assess the role of these control parameters or to test overall algorithm performance. Therefore, we also developed a companion interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010). These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred points across western Oregon and Washington (U.S.A.). Because of the diversity of potential outputs from the LTS data, we evaluated algorithm performance against summary metrics for disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events and longer-duration processes. Despite the apparent complexity of parameters, our results suggest a simple grouping of parameters along a single axis that balances the detection of abrupt events with capture of long-duration trends. Overall algorithm performance was good, capturing a wide range of disturbance and recovery phenomena, even when evaluated against a truth set that contained new targets (recovery and stability) with much subtler thresholds of change than available from prior validation datasets. Temporal segmentation of the archive appears to be a feasible and robust means of increasing information extraction from the Landsat archive. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Using that background, we describe four general steps in natural resource remote sensing projects: image and reference data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and evaluation. We emphasize the practical considerations that arise in each of these steps.

A total 2,166 viable seeds were collected between 2 September 1999 and 6 June 2000. Total seed quantities varied more by site than by tree density, with the xeric site producing six-fold greater seed yields. Within each site, the stand of higher density produced more viable seed. Per-tree cone yields were also greater at the site of lesser productivity. At three of the four stands, tree fecundity (as measured by cone counts) was positively related to diameter at breast height and height, but not to live crown ratio. A difference in temporal seedfall patterns among the two sites occurred late and was relatively minor: most seedfall occurred within the first month after it started regardless of absolute seed production. Seedfall distribution varied spatially within stands, but no seed trap (of 55) received less than an equivalent 28 thousand seeds per hectare. Seedfall was not perceived to be a limiting factor on natural regeneration at any of the four partial-overstory stands in this study.},

For many wild living species, local extinctions of fragmented populations are common and recolonization is critical for regional survival. Successful recolonization depends on the availability of dispersing individuals and the degree of landscape connectivity. The obvious implications of landscape connectivity for conservation biology have led to a proliferation of connectivity measures. However, general relationships between landscape connectivity and landscape structure are lacking, and so are the relationships between different connectivity metrics. Consequently, there is a need to develop landscape metrics that more accurately characterize the landscape with an emphasis on the underlying processes.

  abstract = {AimTo maintain biodiversity in plantation forest ecosystems it is important to understand the community assembly process. Canopy thinning effectively increases understorey diversity in plantation forests. However, the process of understorey community assembly after canopy thinning remains unclear. We compared the relative importance of two mechanisms that could affect the assembly of understorey woody communities after thinning: (1) environmental filtering due to competition from canopy trees, and (2) stochastic immigration. If the latter is dominant, the effectiveness of local treatment might be unpredictable because of the variable probability of immigration at each location. LocationYamagata Prefecture, Japan. MethodsWe censused the understorey tree communities in 18 quadrats (each 1mx1m) in each of 49 stands of Japanese cedar plantations. The mean species richness of the 18 quadrats (alpha-diversity), variation in community composition among them (beta-diversity), deviation of beta-diversity from that of a random community (beta-deviation) and total species richness of the plots (gamma-diversity) were compared among censuses (before thinning, 2 and 5yr after thinning). The relative contributions of two explanatory variables to the various diversities were examined: (1) basal area of canopy trees (overstorey BA, an index of environmental filtering), and (2) available seed source in the surrounding landscape (landscape effect; an index of the probability of immigration). ResultsAlthough neither beta-diversity nor gamma-diversity changed throughout the censuses, the alpha-diversity, stem abundance and beta-deviation were affected by thinning. beta-deviation increased after thinning. Overstorey BA limited alpha- and gamma-diversity throughout the censuses. The landscape effect was more significant in terms of beta-deviation after than before thinning. In addition, the effective scale of the landscape effect increased after thinning. ConclusionOur results indicate that both processes are important: thinning brought about an increase in the relative importance of stochastic immigration as well as a reduction in competitive pressure from canopy trees. These results suggest that while local treatment can increase understorey diversity, stochastic immigration from seed sources is the direct driver after thinning. Although local treatment is effective, its efficiency depends on the seed source availability in the surrounding landscape.},

We found distinct differences in bird communities with increasing fire severity in two vegetation types with naturally different burn severity. The highest severity burns tended to have communities dominated by generalist species, regardless of the original vegetation type. Background and Objectives: Wildfire is the primary natural disturbance in the boreal ecosystems of northwestern Canada. Increased wildfire frequency, extent, and severity are expected with climate change in this region. In particular, the proportion of burns that are high severity and the area of peatlands burned are increasing, and how this influences birds is poorly understood. Materials and Methods: We quantified the effects of burn severity (low, moderate, and high severity) in uplands and peatlands on occupancy, density, richness, community composition, and functional diversity using point counts (n = 1158) from the first two years post-fire for two large fires in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Results: Burn severity had a significant effect on the occupancy and density of 86\% of our focal species (n = 20). Responses to burn severity depended on vegetation type for four of the 18 species using occupancy and seven of the 18 using density, but were typically in a similar direction. Species richness and functional diversity were lower in areas of high severity burns than unburned areas and low severity burns in peatlands. Richness was not related to severity in uplands, but functional diversity was. Peatlands had higher species richness than uplands in all burn severities, but as burn severity increased the upland and peatland communities became more similar. Conclusions: Our results suggest that high severity burns in both vegetation types support five generalist species and two fire specialists that may benefit from alterations in vegetation structure as a result of climate induced changes to fire regimes. However, eight species avoided burns, particularly birds preferring peatlands, and are likely to be more susceptible to fire-driven changes to their habitat caused by climate change. Understanding the long-term risks to these species from climate change requires additional efforts that link fire to bird populations.},

The encroachment of light into previously dark areas was consistently high, often doubling, in areas of high species richness for all four groups. This pattern persisted for nocturnal groups (e.g., bats, owls, and geckos) and species considered vulnerable to extinction. Areas with high species richness and large increases in light extent were clustered within newly industrialized regions where expansion of light is likely to continue unabated unless we act to conserve remaining darkness. Implementing change at a global scale requires global public, and therefore scientific, support. Here, we offer substantial evidence that light extent is increasing where biodiversity is high, representing an emerging threat to global biodiversity requiring immediate attention.},

Our prototype drone is able to fly pre-programmed missions autonomously for a total flight time of similar to 25 minutes and over a distance of similar to 15 km. Non-technical operators can program each mission by defining waypoints along a flight path using an open-source software. This drone can record videos at up to 1080 pixel resolution (high definition), and acquire aerial photographs of {$<$}10 cm pixel resolution. Aerial photographs can be stitched together to produce real-time geo-referenced land use/cover maps of surveyed areas.

We discuss the further development of Conservation Drone 2.0, which will have a bigger payload and longer range. Initial tests suggest a flight time of similar to 50 minutes and a range of similar to 25 km.

Here, we use country-wide ALS data in combination with presence\textendash absence observations of birds from a national monitoring scheme in the Netherlands to quantify niche filling, niche overlap and niche separation of three closely-related wetland birds (great reed warbler, Eurasian reed warbler and Savi's warbler).

The widespread Eurasian reed warbler almost completely filled the available wetland habitat space (93\%) whereas the two other species showed considerably less niche filling (64\% and 74\%, respectively). Substantial niche overlap occurred among all species, but each species occupied a distinct part of the habitat space. The great reed warbler mainly occurred in tall and vertically complex wetland vegetation and was absent in areas with large proportions of reedbeds. The Eurasian reed warbler occupied all parts of the wetland habitat space, whereas the Savi's warbler mainly occurred in large homogenous reedbeds with low vegetation height. Our results demonstrate that broad-scale ecological niche analyses can incorporate the fine-scale 3D habitat preference of species with unprecedented detail (e.g. 10 m resolution), and thus go much beyond quantifying the climate niche and 2D habitat information from land cover maps. This is important to identify habitat features and priorities for biodiversity conservation in wetlands and other habitats.},

  abstract = {Boreal and mountainous forests are a primary focus of conservation efforts and are naturally prone to large-scale disturbances, such as outbreaks of bark beetles. Affected stands are characterised by biological legacies which persist through the disturbance and subsequent succession. The lack of long-term monitoring data on post disturbance forest structure precludes understanding of the complex pathways by which natural disturbances affect forest structure and subsequently species presence. We analysed the response of capercaillie (Tetrao urogolhis) and hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) to bark beetle infestations. We combined high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with a 23-year time series of aerial photography to quantify present-day forest structure and stand disturbance history. Species presence was assessed by collecting droppings of hazel grouse and capercaillie in a citizen science project. Structural equation models showed that the probability of hazel grouse presence increased with increasing disturbance, and the probability of both hazel grouse and capercaillie presence increased with succession. Indirect effects of bark beetle infestations, such as a reduced abundance of deciduous trees and an enhanced herb layer cover, were positively associated with capercaillie presence. Decreasing canopy cover increased the probability of hazel grouse presence. The high temporal and spatial heterogeneity of bark beetle infestations created forest structures that meet the contrasting habitat requirements of both, capercaillie and hazel grouse. This heterogeneity resulted from biological legacies such as decomposing snags, and the simultaneous regrowth of natural regeneration. A benign-neglect strategy towards bark beetle infestations could hence foster capercaillie and hazel grouse in mountainous forests.},

In migratory birds, these factors may even occur in different hemispheres. Therefore, identifying the distribution of populations throughout their annual cycle (i.e., migratory connectivity) can reveal the complex ecological and evolutionary relationships that link species and ecosystems across the globe and illuminate where and how limiting factors influence population trends. A growing body of literature continues to identify species that exhibit weak connectivity wherein individuals from distinct breeding areas co-occur during the nonbreeding period. A detailed account of a broadly distributed species exhibiting strong migratory connectivity in which nonbreeding isolation of populations is associated with differential population trends remains undescribed. Here, we present a range-wide assessment of the nonbreeding distribution and migratory connectivity of two broadly dispersed Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbirds. We used geolocators to track the movements of 70 Vermivora warblers from sites spanning their breeding distribution in eastern North America and identified links between breeding populations and nonbreeding areas. Unlike blue-winged warblers (Vermivora cyanoptera), breeding populations of golden-winged warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) exhibited strong migratory connectivity, which was associated with historical trends in breeding populations: stable for populations that winter in Central America and declining for those that winter in northern South America.},

  abstract = {Aim: Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) are a diverse and essential biota of forests that are vulnerable to species loss through reductions in late-seral habitat. We examined how the spatial ecology of this biota, particularly distance-decay and species-area relationships, could better inform habitat thresholds for EMF conservation planning. Location: Southeast Vancouver Island near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Methods: Using a stratified sampling design, 11 plots (0.15ha in size) were established at 0.05-17.5km apart across 2,800ha of mesic old-growth Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii and Tsuga heterophylla forests. EMF communities were compiled through molecular analysis of root tips and sporocarps. Results: The EMF community was comprised of many Cortinarius, Piloderma, Russula and Tricholoma species typical of mesotrophic habitat. A total of 238 EMF species were observed, of which 86 species were detected only once. The ratio of average species richness per plot (84 taxa) to total richness was low at 0.35, and inherent stochasticity of the EMF community was estimated to be 31\% community dissimilarity for species incidence. Distance decay of EMF communities was nonlinear, with an estimated slope break at 2.6km, followed by a largely unchanging trend in -diversity. Accumulated species-area curves were fitted best by the cumulative Weibull sigmoid model, and the asymptote (367 species) at approx. 50ha was consistent with nonparametric estimates of -diversity (342-362 spp.). Main conclusions: Old-growth forests host an impressive amount of EMF diversity, and many of the Ramaria, Inocybe and Russula species are likely to be endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Both niche- and neutral-based processes influenced EMF community composition, resulting in a minimum threshold of 50ha (1.8\% of the sample area) for capturing -diversity. These spatial patterns will help design and evaluate conservation efforts, such as retention forestry, to sustain fully diverse EMF communities over managed landscapes.},

  abstract = {Woody debris provides substrate for a large part of forest biodiversity. Many saproxylic species are threatened by deadwood removal from commercial forests. However, deadwood availability alone may be insufficient to sustain those specialist species, given that naturally they inhabit diverse and dynamic forest ecosystems. We analysed the occurrence of saproxylic beetles under the conditions of semi-natural forestry in Estonia where managed stands are relatively rich in deadwood. We had two aims: (i) to estimate the role of deadwood amount taking into account other habitat factors for the beetles, and (ii) to contribute to the assessment of ecological sustainability of the silvicultural approaches used. The 128 studied stands represented four management stages: clear-cuts, retention cuts with solitary trees, mature commercial forests, and (as reference) old growth across a gradient of forest site-types. Using flight-intercept traps and rearing from wood samples, we captured 105 pre-defined habitat specialist species, of which 41\% were of regional conservation concern. Site-scale occurrence of 34 species modelled for habitat factors depended mostly on management stage and forest type. Harvested sites (particularly retention cuts) were primarily preferred, and dry pine sites had a distinct fauna. Thirteen percent of target species favoured old growth, but in general, the beetle assemblages in old growth resembled those in mature commercial forest. Statistical significance of any stand characteristics (site type; stand structure) was established in only 62\% of species, which indicates that there can be additional important factors, such as habitat connectivity, patch size or landscape history. These results highlight the importance of diverse forest management and protection approaches for deadwood-dwellers, which should aim for habitat heterogeneity along with substrate diversity. For beetle diversity, retention cutting performs much better than clear-cutting, but even deadwood-rich mature stands cannot fully substitute old growth. We conclude that deadwood abundance serves only as a starting consideration for reconciling timber production and the conservation of deadwood dependent biodiversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Determining habitat attributes used by animals of conservation concern at different spatial scales is a key aspect of developing effective recovery plans. Managers must know whether forest songbirds choose habitat based on selection of specific plant species or on structural features shared by different plant species. Coarse-scale habitat features were measured at point count locations and fine-scale characteristics within and adjacent to breeding territories of Canada Warblers (Cardellina canadensis L.) in central Alberta, Canada. Differences in the plant community composition in breeding territories between forest interior and shoreline sites were examined. Breeding success in each breeding territory was estimated through observations of males carrying food. At coarse-scales, Canada Warbler occurrence was positively correlated with shrub density and was higher in deciduous forests. At a fine-scale, woody plant species composition differed significantly between interior and shoreline sites (pseudo-F=32.61, P=0.001), but did not differ between plots located inside and outside bird territories (pseudo-F=1.22, P=0.26). Choke cherry (Prunus virginiana) was an indicator species within bird territories, however. Birds with evidence of breeding success had significantly more green alder (Alnus crispa) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) in their territories, whereas territories without evidence of breeding success were more likely to have trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), twining honeysuckle (Lonicera dioica) and Canada buffaloberry (Shepherdia canadensis). The results highlight that Canada Warbler presence is strongly correlated with canopy type and shrub density. There was also evidence that certain shrub and tree species are more abundant at the core of bird territories. These results will help inform critical habitat identification for Canada Warblers in western Canada. Land managers should use forest inventory data sources that include information on shrub density when trying to locate important habitat for Canada Warblers, while being aware that locally, specific plant species may influence Canada Warbler habitat choices and breeding success.},

  abstract = {Retaining trees for conservation at final harvest is becoming increasingly common within forestry globally, especially connected to clearcutting. The main action is to leave single living and dead trees, tree patches and buffer strips, to benefit biodiversity and to enhance ecosystem functioning. We present the first national analysis of effects on structural components from applying the retention approach. In Sweden retention forestry has been practiced large-scale for about 25 years, prescribed by the law and a requirement in certification standards. By analyzing data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory we found that the volume of dead trees ({$>$}= 100 mm in diameter; single trees and trees in patches {$<$}0.02 ha; data for larger retention patches not available) in stands 0-10 years old increased about 70\% during the period 1997-2007, with a current average level of 8 m(3) ha(-1), and with a larger increase rate in this age class than in other forest ages. Retained living trees ({$>$}= 150 mm in diameter; single trees and trees in patches {$<$}0.02 ha; data for larger retention patches not available) decreased in quantity from 1955 until the early 1980s, with lowest levels of about 5 ha(-1) (excluding Pinus sylvestris, commonly used as a seed tree) and then increased, approximately reaching the 1950s level by 2007, with about 15 trees ha(-1) on average. Large-scale application of the clearcutting practice is the probable cause of the decrease, whilst retention actions are the likely explanation for the increase during the last decades. Our study clearly shows that young forests have become structurally richer since the introduction of the retention approach in forestry. However, comparatively low amounts of dead wood in forests 0-10 years old compared to what is available in old forests imply loss at harvest and studies of possible mechanisms to explain this are needed. Our results can indicate possible changes in other parts of the world, where the retention approach has been introduced more recently. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We reviewed the concepts, theories, and strategies related to NDE in boreal forest management. We also reviewed publications that discussed NDE in the boreal forest in general and those that specifically compared NDE-based management with conventional even-aged management. The papers generally focused on northern North America and landscape-scale wildfire as the main disturbance factor, wherea s information from Eurasia was exclusively theoretical. Within this limited scope, NDE was generally found to have a positive effect on biodiversity in terms of forest structure and species diversity when compared with conventional even-aged management. Studies on timber supply and social implications of NDE were so few that they preclude generalizations. We conclude that the ecological and economic performance of NDE as a management approach still remains poorly examined. To advance the development of NDE, particular attention should be given to (1) augmenting the knowledge base on natural range of variability of unmanaged forest ecosystems and evaluating the validity of this information in a changing climate, (2) fostering multidisciplinary research with better integration of ecological theory to both integrative and analytical research on NDE, and (3) better integration of socioeconomic concerns, adaptive management schemes, and international collaboration into NDE initiatives.},

  abstract = {The circumboreal forest encompasses diverse landscape structures, dynamics and forest age distributions determined by their physical setting, and historical and current disturbance regimes. However, due to intensifying forest utilisation, and in certain areas due to increasing natural disturbances, boreal forest age-class structures have changed rapidly, so that the proportion of old forest has substantially declined, while that of young post-harvest and post-natural-disturbance forest proportions have increased. In the future, with a warming climate in certain boreal regions, this trend may further be enhanced due to an increase in natural disturbances and large-scale use of forest biomass to replace fossil-based fuels and products. The major drivers of change of forest age class distributions and structures include the use of clearcut short-rotation harvesting, more frequent and severe natural disturbances due to climate warming in certain regions. The decline in old forest area, and increase in managed young forest lacking natural post-disturbance structural legacies, represent a major transformation in the ecological conditions of the boreal forest beyond historical limits of variability. This may introduce a threat to biodiversity, ecosystem resilience and long-term adaptive capacity of the forest ecosystem. To safeguard boreal forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and to maintain the multiple services provided to societies by this forest biome, it is pivotal to maintain an adequate share and the ecological qualities of young post-disturbance stages, along with mature forest stages with old-growth characteristics. This requires management for natural post-disturbance legacy structures, and innovative use of diverse uneven-aged and continuous cover management approaches to maintain critical late-successional forest structures in landscapes.},

  abstract = {Introduction This is the Third Special Issue on Spatial Ecology in the International Journal of Geographical Information Science, with the first being published in 2011 (issue 3 of volume 25; Skidmore et al. 2011) and the second in 2012 (issue 11 of volume 26; Laffan et al. 2012). Spatial ecology addresses the effect of spatial patterning on ecological processes (Skidmore et al. 2011) and the papers in this special issue both address new topics and advance the themes of the preceding special issues. As is to be expected for a journal such as this, developing novel methods and applying established techniques in new ways are an important theme (e.g. Zhang et al. 2011, de Bie et al. 2012). In this issue, there are two papers that report the use of cost path analyses to better represent the connections between locations (Hanke et al. 2014, Hohl et al. 2014). Such approaches have the potential to make important refinements to many explicitly spatial analyses, and these papers contribute to an increasing literature on this topic (Laffan 2002, Adriaensen et al. 2003, Lyon et al. 2010, Greenberg et al. 2011, Etherington 2012, Nelson and Robertson 2012, Laffan and Taylor 2013, Radinger et al. 2013). McCue et al. (2014) also address a methodological issue, comparing the ability of two types of models to predict habitat use for a wide-ranging mammal. Consistent with applications across the fields of geography and ecology, the papers in this issue span a variety of spatial extent and grain, ranging from the micro-scale (Sillero and Gon\c{c}alves-Seco 2014) through landscape (Ficetola et al. 2014), regional (Beltr\'an et al. 2014, Bino et al. 2014, McCue et al. 2014) to continental scales (Peters et al. 2014). Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a recurring theme in spatial ecology and is represented here in several papers (Beltr\'an et al. 2014, Bino et al. 2014, Ficetola et al. 2014, Mateo S\'anchez et al. 2014, McCue et al. 2014, Peters et al. 2014, Sillero and Gon\c{c}alves-Seco 2014). These papers address ways in which the representation of species distributions varies with scale (both grain and extent). Two papers introduce methods for mapping species ranges (Di Virgilio and Laffan 2014, Peters et al. 2014). Peters et al. delimit boundaries of the core range from discontinuous distributions predicted using SDMs \textendash{} core range may be needed for studying source-sink dynamics. Conversely, Di Virgilio and Laffan presented methods for mapping variation in distributions within traditional range maps based on spatial analysis of point occurrence data to provide more fine-grained biodiversity information. Beltr\'an et al. (2014) use SDM to explore the ability of a regional conservation network to support multiple species of conservation concern under climate and land use change scenarios. This points to the need for considering appropriate spatial extents when managing for species persistence. Mateo S\'anchez et al. (2014) demonstrate scale depen-dence in habitat selection for an endangered megavertebrate. As always, the accuracy and utility of SDMs are influenced by the choice and quality of data (Williams et al. 2012). Issues such as the selection of GIS data layers for SDMs (e.g. through consideration of collinear variables) as well as the spatial autocorrelation within a data layer are considered by many authors. The previous special issues contain several papers addressing data quality issues in spatial ecological modelling, including sample size, sampling bias, measurement error, spatial non-stationarity and model selec-tion (Leit\~ao et al. 2011, Livne and Svoray 2011, Miller and Hanham 2011, Golicher et al. 2012, Moudr\'y and \v{S}\'imov\'a 2012). Here, Bino et al. (2014) focus on the effectiveness of multi-species survey techniques that are informed by SDMs, while two papers show the advantage of using LiDAR data to obtain better estimates of the habitat structure available to animals (Ficetola et al. 2014, Sillero and Gon\c{c}alves-Seco 2014). Papers in the previous special issues have primarily focused on terrestrial environ-ments (e.g. David Walter et al. 2011, Amboni and Laffan 2012, Burley et al. 2012, de Bie et al. 2012, Scull et al. 2012), with some marine (Hamylton 2012, Huang et al. 2012) and one aquatic (Chee and Elith 2012). This issue continues with the primary focus on terrestrial environments, but importantly there are two examples for aquatic environments (Hanke et al. 2014, Hohl et al. 2014). There is also a strong focus in this issue on vertebrate species, including mammals (Bino et al. 2014, Mateo S\'anchez et al. 2014, McCue et al. 2014), reptiles (Di Virgilio and Laffan 2014, Sillero and Gon\c{c}alves-Seco 2014) and fish (Hanke et al. 2014). The inclusion of micro-organisms (Hohl et al. 2014) is further indication of the broad reach of spatial ecology. There remains considerable potential for the use of geospatial data and analysis tools to address important questions in spatial ecology (Skidmore et al. 2011, Laffan et al. 2012). This series of special issues serve to demonstrate the potential as well as the best practice of spatial ecology and will be followed by a fourth special issue on spatial ecology in IJGIS with the aim to further explore how the science and techniques of geographical information can continue to inform government and business in sustainable development and conservation of natural resources.

  abstract = {Understanding the causes underlying changes in species diversity is a fundamental pursuit of ecology. Animal species richness and composition often change with decreased forest structural complexity associated with logging. Yet differences in latitude and forest type may strongly influence how species diversity responds to logging. We performed a meta-analysis of logging effects on local species richness and composition of birds across the world and assessed responses by different guilds (nesting strata, foraging strata, diet, and body size). This approach allowed identification of species attributes that might underlie responses to this anthropogenic disturbance. We only examined studies that allowed forests to regrow naturally following logging, and accounted for logging intensity, spatial extent, successional regrowth after logging, and the change in species composition expected due to random assembly from regional species pools. Selective logging in the tropics and clearcut logging in temperate latitudes caused loss of species from nearly all forest strata (ground to canopy), leading to substantial declines in species richness (up to 27\% of species). Few species were lost or gained following any intensity of logging in lower-latitude temperate forests, but the relative abundances of these species changed substantially. Selective logging at higher-temperate latitudes generally replaced late-successional specialists with early-successional specialists, leading to no net changes in species richness but large changes in species composition. Removing less basal area during logging mitigated the loss of avian species from all forests and, in some cases, increased diversity in temperate forests. This meta-analysis provides insights into the important role of habitat specialization in determining differential responses of animal communities to logging across tropical and temperate latitudes.},

Using the Heureka system, scenarios of 0\%, 5\%, and 20\% retained patches at the stand level were projected over 200 years in a 533 ha boreal landscape. Visualizations of future forest states at a landscape scale and a more detailed scale were made based on the projections. The no retention results in no forest {$>$}120 years old, and no large trees (diameter at breast height {$>$}40 cm for conifers and {$>$}35 cm for broadleaved trees) 100 years from now. With retention levels of 5\% and 20\%, the area of old forest will comprise 7\% and 19\% of the total area, respectively. The average number of large trees per ha will be 4 and 13, respectively. Deadwood volumes will be 2.5 times higher at 5\% retention and 4 times higher at 20\% retention compared to no retention. Landscape visualizations indicate that retention patches covering 5\% will marginally modify the visual impression, compared to clear-cuts, while 20\% cover will create a much more varied landscape. We conclude that the retention approach is essential for restoring natural conditions. Landscape transformation will be slow and depend on starting conditions and retention levels.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about the relationship between habitat structure and abundance of a target species facilitates biodiversity conservation in managed forests. However, modeling the relationship for infrequent small mammal species in silvicultural experiments introduces the challenge of excessive zero counts and complex hierarchical sampling. A common solution has been to ignore infrequent species. The goal of this study was to model microhabitat associations of infrequently captured forest floor small mammal species with Bayesian models that accounted for subsampling and the blocking design of a large-scale variable-retention harvest experiment. Poisson, negative binomial and overdispersed Poisson Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were fitted to data for three small mammal species with different rates of capture. Shrew-mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii) and Keen's deer mouse (Peromyscus keetti) were the two infrequent species and southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi) was the frequent species selected for modeling. Capture rate was predicted from variables representing vegetation structure, and results were compared to corresponding Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). GLMMs predicted stronger and sometimes contrary effects of vegetation structure with wider confidence intervals compared to GLMs. The overdispersed Poisson GLMM provided the most consistent and adequate fit to infrequent species. Capture rate of the shrew-mole was found to be negatively associated with tall shrub cover and coarse woody debris volume. Similarly, capture rate of Keen's deer mouse was negatively associated with herb cover and coarse woody debris volume. Finally, captures of southern red-backed vole was associated negatively with herb cover and coarse woody debris volume but positively associated with vertical complexity of overstory vegetation. With correct GLMM specification, statistical inferences of habitat predictors were more reliable as autocorrelation between samples was properly accounted for and valid standard errors were estimated. Furthermore, the GLMMs in this study fitted capture rates of infrequent species well and produced admissible results on the association of these species to microhabitat features. Infrequent species need not be excluded from analysis; in fact, inclusion of these species is crucial to conservation of species diversity by designing silvicultural treatments that produce or protect suitable habitat.

  abstract = {Epiphytic lichens, comprising an important biodiversity component with significant functions in old boreal forests, are susceptible to logging. Leaving retention trees may partly compensate for the adverse effects of logging, but the impact of logging season on retained lichens is unknown. To identify the least harmful logging season seen from an epiphytic lichen perspective, we simulated logging events by transplanting two old forest model species - Lobaria pulmonaria (cephalolichen) and Lobaria scrobiculata (cyanolichen) - in summer, autumn, winter and spring, respectively. Lichens were collected in intact old forests and transplanted in clear-cuts. They were placed on five aspects (N, E, S, W, and top) on artificial stands covered with bark. They all gained biomass and area in the following year. However, logging in January resulted in subsequent higher relative growth rates than in lichens being exposed to clear cuts in other seasons, consistent with clear seasonal logging effects. Aspect impacted lichen growth less than logging season, despite significant bleaching and chlorophyll contents in the most exposed aspects. The high annual growth rate and the low level of damage after transplantation to clear cuts during winter suggest that green tree retention (GTR) logging practices in winter can support life-boating of susceptible old forest lichen epiphytes. Logging simulation during other seasons than winter resulted in lower growth, implying higher risk of permanent damage. Successful use of GTR cannot compensate for the loss of epiphytes at timber harvest, but supports local retained lichen populations that subsequently may boost re-colonization of the young stand.

  abstract = {Estimating forest structural attributes is one of the essential forestry-related remote sensing applications. The methods applied so far typically concentrate on the structure of the overstorey. For various conservation and man-agement applications, however, information on lower layers is also of great interest. Detecting understorey cover by remote sensing is challenging, as passive sensors do not penetrate to the forest ground layer. An alternative to these is 3D metrics from active light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Here, we evaluate this technique for describing the vegetation density of multiple stand layers within the temperate stands of a large protected area in south-eastern Germany. We combined LiDAR metrics and information on forest habitat types with regression models to investigate LiDAR metrics that are significantly correlated with vegetation density. The top canopy and the herbal layer showed strong correlations with the applied LiDAR metrics, whereas the predictive power was lower for the intermediate stand layers. Moreover, our results suggest that the relationship between LiDAR predictors and vegetation density depends on the forest type. A comparison of the regression models with random forest pre-dictions showed no major improvement in predictive error. In conclusion, this study highlights the value of the LiDAR metrics for characterizing the structural properties of lower forest layers, which has implications for wildlife and forest management applications, especially in protected areas.},

We used acoustics to investigate the resilience of a folivorous marsupial, the koala Phascolarctos cinereus, to timber harvesting where a key mitigation practice is landscape exclusion of harvesting. We deployed acoustic recorders at 171 sites to record male bellows (similar to 14,640 hours) for use in occupancy modelling and for comparisons of bellow rate (bellows night(-1)). Surveys targeted modelled medium-high quality habitat, with sites stratified by time since logging and logging intensity, including old growth as a reference. After scanning recordings with software to identify koala bellows, we found a high probability of detection (0.45 per night), but this varied with minimum temperature and recorder type. Naive occupancy was similar to 64\% across a broad range of forests, which was at least five times more than expected based on previous surveys using alternative methods. After accounting for imperfect detection, probability of occupancy was influenced by elevation (-ve), cover of important browse trees (+ve), landscape NDVI (+ve) and extent of recent wildfire (-ve, but minor effect). Elevation was the most influential variable, though the relationship was non-linear and low occupancy was most common at tableland elevations ({$>$} 1000 m). Neither occupancy nor bellow rate were influenced by timber harvesting intensity, time since harvesting or local landscape extent of harvesting or old growth. Extrapolation of occupancy across modelled habitat indicates that the hinterland forests of north-east NSW support a widespread, though likely low density koala population that is considerably larger than previously estimated. Retention forestry has a significant role to play in mitigating harvesting impacts on biodiversity, including for forest specialists, but localised studies are needed to optimise prescriptions for koalas.},

  abstract = {Saproxylic (i.e., deadwood-associated) insects are important functional components of biological diversity in forest ecosystems; however, they depend on microhabitats associated with dying, dead, and decaying wood that are dramatically altered by industrial forestry. Habitat loss and fragmentation by activities, such as clear-cutting, salvage logging, and bioenergy extraction, threaten saproxylic biodiversity on forested landscapes through changes in quantity, quality, and dynamics of deadwood. Retention forestry has been proposed and widely applied to support conservation and recovery of biodiversity and the associated ecological function on managed landscapes. In spite of its short history, retention forestry has undoubtedly had positive effects on biodiversity compared to conventional clear-cut harvest. The amount and pattern of retention are two important factors that determine biotic and abiotic responses and thereby influence success of retention approach. We review major findings from several large-scale variable retention experiments that have considered impacts on saproxylic insects. General conclusions from these experiments include the following three points: (1) aggregated retention conserves saproxylic insect faunas better than dispersed retention; (2) mixes of aggregated and dispersed retention have greater conservation value for saproxylic beetles than a single retention type; and (3) inclusion of prescribed burning will improve the conservation performance of retention forestry approaches. Successful conservation of saproxylic insect populations will likely depend on management to ensure availability of a full range of deadwood quantities and qualities in harvested and regenerating forest stands. We argue that variable retention harvesting, which includes sufficient amounts of retained trees as combinations of aggregated and dispersed retention, will best support diversity of deadwood habitats in the harvested matrix and promote conservation and local recovery of saproxylic assemblages.},

Neither species richness nor emergence of beetles differed among freshly cut bolts exposed as ``horizontal\{''\} or ``upright\{''\} in retention patches of two sizes (0.20 ha and 0.46 ha) that were surrounded by different levels of dispersed retention (2\%, 20\%, and 50\%). However, species composition in retention patches differed significantly from those in unharvested controls, except in the larger patches surrounded by 50\% dispersed retention, although patterns differed among feeding guilds. Both mycetophage and predator assemblages in patches were similar to those in unharvested controls, suggesting that even relatively small patches retain these guilds regardless of the surrounding matrix quality. Because species composition differed between horizontal and upright bolts, an appropriate mix of horizontal and upright CWM may contribute to conservation of saproxylic beetle faunas.},

To clarify size of retention patches needed to effectively conserve saproxylic (i.e., deadwood-associated) beetles in western Canada, we compared beetle assemblages among patches of three size categories (small: 0.63-1.06 ha, medium: 1.43-2.93 ha, and large: 3.34-5.93 ha) left in harvested areas with those from intact forests and harvested matrix. To understand edge effects as a potential driver of faunal changes associated with patch size, we also compared assemblages from edges and centers of retention patches. Saproxylic beetle assemblages similar to those in intact forests were well maintained in all patch centers, but assemblages in small and medium patches were strongly influenced by edge effects and were least similar to those in intact forests. Particular trophic guilds showed distinct responses to patch size. Predator assemblages showed negative edge effects in small and medium patches, while phloeophage assemblages did not differ between edges and centers of different patch sizes. Although smaller patches may better emulate historical size distributions of fire skips, conservation value is likely maximized in large patches, mainly by decreasing edge effects. Our study dealt mainly with `initial colonizers', but further studies to define minimum patch size for retention harvest must be conducted over time to incorporate effects on species associated with well-decayed deadwood.

While statistical techniques are advancing at a fast pace, there is confusion in the conceptual understanding of the meaning of various quantities that these statistical techniques provide. Terms such as selection, choice, use, occupancy and preference often are employed as if they are synonymous. Many practitioners are unclear about the distinctions between different concepts such as 'probability of selection,' 'probability of use,' 'choice probabilities' and 'probability of occupancy'. Similarly, practitioners are not always clear about the differences between and relevance of 'relative probability of selection' vs. 'probability of selection' to effective management. Practitioners also are unaware that they are using only a single statistical model for modelling resource selection, namely the exponential probability of selection, when other models might be more appropriate. Currently, such multimodel inference is lacking in the resource selection literature. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the concepts and terminology used in animal resource studies by illustrating the relationships among these various concepts and providing their statistical underpinnings.},

The choice of biodiversity metrics can substantially affect the evaluation of conservation tools. However, the relative sensitivity of different metrics is not well investigated , especially in a multi-taxon framework. Location: European beech forests in Denmark. Methods: We studied 20 beech stands comprising four management types (from intensively managed to long unmanaged stands). We analyzed how management-related environmental variables were reflected in the measure of: (i) species richness, (ii) number of conservation-relevant species (red-listed species and old-growth forest indicators) and (iii) functional diversity targeting five organism groups with different habitat requirements , i.e. vascular plants, epiphytic lichens and bryophytes, saproxylic fungi and breeding birds. Results: Plain species richness at stand level was generally misleading, as it did not capture changes in the number of conservation relevant species with changes in management-related environmental variables. The interpretation of functional responses was most informative for the better known vascular plants, while responses were more fragmented for the other organism groups. Overall, however, functional responses were consistent with a loss of specialization and progressive simplification of species assemblages from long-un-managed to intensively managed stands. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the occurrence of conservation-relevant species is a sound and relevant metric for planning and evaluating conservation actions, especially for less studied organism groups (e.g., sa-proxylic fungi and epiphytes). The functional approach is promising, but presupposes the availability of databases of relevant traits.},

However, only 15\% of the recovery strategies we evaluated examined relationships between habitat and population viability, abundance, individual fitness, or survival. Furthermore, the breadth of evidence used to assess critical habitats was weaker among long-lived taxa and did not improve over time. H...},

To optimize conservation opportunities, managing urban ROWs for grassland birds may require reductions in frequent mowing and spraying and may also depend on the suitability of landscape structure within the urban environment. We compared effects of mowing regime relative to effects of the matrix surrounding ROWs on grassland bird abundance and occupancy along 48 ROWs in and surrounding Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2007-2009. We used both hierarchical distance-sampling and multiseason occupancy modeling methods to account for effects of urbanization (e.g., traffic noise), observer experience, time of season, and survey time in the morning on the probability of detecting birds at study sites. We did not find differences in detection of grassland birds due to urbanization, but we did find effects of time of season, survey time in the morning, and observer experience. After accounting for availability, we found that several species declined along ROWs that were surrounded by more urban or wooded land. Western Meadowlark occupancy increased as the amount of grassland within 100 m of ROWs increased. Savannah Sparrow showed some evidence of increasing with mowing, whereas Clay-colored Sparrow showed some evidence of decreasing with mowing, although these species and Western Meadowlark also increased within hayed ROWs. We conclude that urban ROWs managed as grassland bird habitats will probably attract more individuals and species if there is less nearby urban or wooded land and more grassland, and within which there is a mixture of unmowed and hayed ROW sections.},

Our hypotheses were: (1) species associated with older mixed-wood stands would decline more if harvest was shifted away from areas used by caribou to areas with more mixed-wood; and (2) species associated with older forests would be more negatively affected by the combined effects of harvest, fire, and non-forestry footprint than by harvest alone. We used vegetation data from two harvest scenarios produced in Patchworks as inputs for density models of 20 boreal forest songbird and woodpecker species in Alberta. We projected abundance of these species over 50 years under: 1) two scenarios created in Patchworks, without fire but with and without deferral of timber harvest within a caribou conservation zone on lands tenured to Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries Inc.; (2) a scenario with fire but no human footprint; and (3) five scenarios in ALCES Online, in which habitat was affected by Patchworks harvest locations, fire (1-2 \texttimes{} current rate), and energy sector development (present or absent; with or without seismic line reclamation to improve caribou habitat). In the Patchworks scenarios, we found similar projected numbers of each bird species over time, whether harvest deferral occurred or not. Both harvest plans increased habitat and numbers for most species associated with older forests over 50 years, while most species associated with younger forests declined in both harvest plans, because average projected forest age increased over 50 years. Fire and other footprint generally reduced relative amount of habitat for species associated with older forests, which still increased over time, while other species responded positively or less negatively to fire.

However, there are virtually no longitudinal studies that have assessed long-term effects of forest harvesting on boreal birds. The Calling Lake Fragmentation Study is a long-term experiment in northern Alberta's boreal forest, established in 1993. We have 24 years of avian point count data (1993\textendash 2016) from this study site, giving us the opportunity to study how the boreal songbird community has responded over 23 years to forest regeneration after harvesting. We ran multi-season occupancy models of 51 species surveyed at 72 stations (8 stations per 40-ha sampling area) within 3 unharvested forest sites, 3 harvest units that were cut in 1984 and treated to enhance conifer survival, and 3 harvest units that were cut in 1994 and left untreated to regenerate naturally. Eight of 21 species associated with older boreal forests ({$\geq$}60\textendash 80 years old) used harvest units 23\textendash 33 years post-harvest. Eleven of 16 species associated with shrublands or younger forests used harvest units, before declining as harvest units regenerated, while four of 16 such species increased their probability of occupying harvest units over the monitoring period. Increased occupancy by 5 Neotropical migrants and 2 short-distance migrants was associated with increased El Nino weather events preceding a given breeding season. We also found evidence that increased occupancy of 3 species within harvest units was preceded by and correlated with increased occupancy by those species in unharvested forests, while occupancy of 4 species in unharvested forests was preceded by and correlated with increased occupancy within harvest units. Our results indicate the importance of unharvested forests for some boreal songbird species, the utility of longitudinal studies with controls for assessing changes in occupancy due to forest regeneration in harvest units versus factors operating at larger spatial scales, and the potential of harvest units to serve as habitat for boreal birds up to 33 years post-harvest.},

  abstract = {Aim Large disturbances increasingly shape the world's forests. Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance-interaction theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been addressed in empirical research globally. Insights First, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely result from interaction modifications-i.e., from non-additive effects-between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging disturbance due to complex socio-ecological interactions. Both interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that, whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date. Conclusions Interactions between natural disturbance and logging imply that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.},

Since the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement--a reporting guideline published in 1999--there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature.

Higher retention levels are thought to promote faster, more complete ecological recovery after logging, but this hypothesis is insufficiently tested. We compared plant community dynamics in 0\%, 40\% and 70\% retention stands to unharvested stands for 24 years after logging at the Date Creek Research Forest near Kispiox, BC, Canada. The study has a before-after control-impact experimental design with four replicates of each treatment. For terricolous understory plants, we used the similarity of cover, species richness and composition to pre-harvest and unharvested conditions as indicators of ecological integrity. Changes in cover, richness and composition were greatest at 0\% retention. For nonvascular plants, changes were generally intermediate at 40\% retention and smallest at 70\% retention, and recovery increased with retention. The dominant moss Hylocomiurn splendens responded negatively to harvest in proportion to retention level, while most other species responded positively, shifting community composition. Most vascular plants responded positively to harvest, especially at 0\% retention, with the exception of two late seral species, Platanthera orbicuinta and Oplopanax horridus. Generally, understory communities in these largely unfragmented northern cedar-hemlock forests displayed less sensitivity to low retention levels than studies conducted elsewhere. For some vascular plant indicators, changes at 70\% retention were equal to or greater than those at 40\%. Thus, most-but not all-vegetation responses supported the hypothesis that higher retention enhances ecological recovery after logging. The non-linear results were apparently driven by suppression of understory conifer growth in small gaps at 70\% retention and illustrate that evaluating ecological integrity strictly in terms of departure from an un-impacted benchmark system risks oversimplifying complex forest dynamics.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of airborne laser scanning (ALS) and forest estimates derived from satellite images extracted at two spatial scales for predicting the stand-scale abundance and species richness of birds and beetles in a managed boreal forest landscape. Multiple regression models based on forest data from a 50-m radius (i.e., corresponding to a homogenous forest stand) had better explanatory power than those based on a 200-m radius (i.e., including also parts of adjacent stands). Bird abundance and species richness were best explained by the ALS variables "maximum vegetation height" and "vegetation cover between 0.5 and 3 m" (both positive). Flying beetle abundance and species richness, as well as epigaeic (i.e., ground-living) beetle richness were best explained by a model including the ALS variable "maximum vegetation height" (positive) and the satellite-derived variable "proportion of pine" (negative). Epigaeic beetle abundance was best explained by "maximum vegetation height" at 50 m (positive) and "stem volume" at 200 m (positive). Our results show that forest estimates derived from satellite images and ALS data provide complementary information for explaining forest biodiversity patterns. We conclude that these types of remote sensing data may provide an efficient tool for conservation planning in managed boreal landscapes.},

  abstract = {The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the important goals of managing for-ests in an ecologically sustainable way. Ecologists and forest resource managers need measures to judge the success or failure of management regimes designed to sustain biological diversity. The relationships between potential indicator species and total biodiversity are not well established. Carefully designed studies are re-quired to test relationships between the presence and abundance of potential indicator species and other taxa and the maintenance of critical ecosystem processes in forests. Other indicators of biological diversity in forests, in addition or as alternatives to indicator species, include what we call structure-based indicators. These are stand-level and landscape-level (spatial) features of forests such as stand structural complexity and plant species composition, connectivity, and heterogeneity. Although the adoption of practices to sustain (or recreate) key characteristics of forest ecosystems appear intuitively sensible and broadly consistent with cur-rent knowledge, information is lacking to determine whether such stand-and landscape-level features of for-ests will serve as successful indices of (and help conserve) biodiversity. Given our limited knowledge of both indicator species and structure-based indicators, we advocate the following four approaches to enhance biodiversity conservation in forests: (1) establish biodiversity priority areas (e.g., reserves) managed prima-rily for the conservation of biological diversity; (2) within production forests, apply structure-based indica-tors including structural complexity, connectivity, and heterogeneity; (3) using multiple conservation strate-gies at multiple spatial scales, spread out risk in wood production forests; and (4) adopt an adaptive management approach to test the validity of structure-based indices of biological diversity by treating man-agement practices as experiments. These approaches would aim to provide new knowledge to managers and improve the effectiveness of current management strategies.

The inherent multi-variate nature of landscape processes and responses of individual species and assemblages that creates var-iability in datasets. This may lead to a limited ability to make accurate predictions from threshold relationships, even when those relationships are highly statistically significant. We believe that although the threshold concept is an appealing one and there is some empirical evidence to support it in some landscapes, it is not free of problems and a concerted research effort on the topic is needed. This is particularly important if it is to have value for robustly underpinning applied landscape management practices without unintentionally having negative impacts on rates of species loss or the loss of particular species.},

Given the spatial extent of unprotected forests, finding management approaches that will sustain their multiple environmental, economic, and cultural values and prevent their conversion to other uses is imperative. The major global challenge of native forest management is further demonstrated by ongoing steep declines in forest biodiversity and carbon stocks. Here, we suggest that an essential part of such management-supplementing the protection of large reserves and sensitive areas within forest landscapes (e.g., aquatic features)-is the adoption of the retention approach in forests where logging occurs. This ecological approach to harvesting provides for permanent retention of important selected structures (e.g., trees and decayed logs) to provide for continuity of ecosystem structure, function, and species composition in the postharvest forest. The retention approach supports the integration of environmental, economic, and cultural values and is broadly applicable to tropical, temperate, and boreal forests, adaptable to different management objectives, and appropriate in different societal settings. The widespread adoption of the retention approach would be one of the most significant changes in management practice since the onset of modern high-yield forestry. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The Variable Retention Harvest System (VRHS) is a silvicultural system designed to reduce logging impacts and enhance biodiversity conservation. VRHS has been widely applied worldwide but several important questions remain about its effectiveness for biodiversity conservation. A key issue is whether dispersed or aggregated retention is more effective for conservation, and hence what size of retained patches of forest should be maintained within logged areas. Many studies have indicated that increasing the amount of the original stand retained during harvesting increases the amount of biodiversity conserved. But in a form of the SLOSS (single large or several small areas for conservation) debate, a critical question is: does one large retained island better conserve forest biota than several small islands of the same aggregated area? We addressed this question in an experiment in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The experiment comprised seven blocks, each with four treatments - an unlogged control, a conventional 15-40 ha clearfelled area, a 15-40 ha harvest unit with a single 1.5 ha retained ``island\{''\}, and a 15-40 ha harvest unit with three 0.5 ha islands. A subset of the treatment plots and harvest units in our experiment were burned in a major wildfire in 2009. Given this, a subsequent further question we posed was: are there additional effects on birds resulting from logging operations that were followed by wildfires. We identified a significant gradient in species richness across treatments with lowest values in conventional clearfelled areas and highest values in unlogged controls. Unexpectedly, we identified no significant island size effects on bird species richness. We found no individual species that were significantly more likely to occur in a single large island than several small islands. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed significant differences in the composition of the bird community between treatments, consistent with our findings for some of the more common species of birds. Several species were significantly less likely to be recorded in clearfelled areas, although the Flame Robin was more likely to be recorded in them. When we removed clearfelled areas from our analyses, some species were significantly less likely to occur in retained islands than unlogged controls. The application of VRHS did not appear to mediate bird responses to wildfire relative to effects for birds observed in clearfelled harvest units that were subsequently burned in 2009. Our results suggest that VRHS has positive effects on bird biota in Mountain Ash forests. However, this study found no advantage of setting aside a single large island versus several small islands within a given harvest unit for bird species richness nor the occurrence of individual bird species.

  abstract = {1. Forests world-wide are increasingly subject to natural and human disturbances, including wildfires and logging of varying intensity and frequency. Understanding how biodiversity responds to different kinds and combinations of natural and human disturbance is critical to enhanced forest management. 2. We completed an 8-year study of bird responses across a spectrum of disturbance types in Australian mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests following wildfires in 2009. 3. We found evidence of a gradient in bird species richness over the study duration. It was highest in unlogged and unburned (least disturbed) sites, decreasing through burnt unlogged forest (subject to high or low intensity fire), lower still in logged forest, and lowest in the most disturbed sites (subject to salvage logging without island retention). Retention of uncut islands within logged areas increased bird species richness above that found in areas that had been clearcut. 4. The greatest rate of increase per year after disturbance in bird species richness was on sites burnt by high-severity fire but which were not subject to any form of logging. The level of disturbance affected the composition of the bird assemblage. Sites that were unlogged and unburned were more likely to support species that were larger, more mobile, and nested at greater heights above the ground. 5. Synthesis and applications. All forms of logging on burned sites impaired recovery in bird species richness relative to sites subject to high-severity fire. Alterations in stand structure and plant species composition (and hence modification in bird habitat suitability) due to logging are the most likely reasons for reduced bird species richness and delayed patterns of recovery. This study highlights the importance for native bird species of retaining patches of unlogged forest not only within otherwise clearcut forest, but also in areas that are burned and subject to salvage logging. We therefore suggest that the adoption of retention harvesting be expanded to include stands disturbed by wildfires.},

  abstract = {An objective, quantifiable index of structural biodiversity that could be rapidly obtained with reduced or no field effort is essential for the use of structure as universal ecological indicator for ecosystem management. Active remote sensing provides a rapid assessment tool to potentially guide land managers in highly dynamic and spatially complex landscapes. These landscapes are often dependent on frequent disturbance regimes and characterized by high endemism. We propose a modified Shannon-Wiener Index and modified Evenness Index as stand structural complexity indices for surrogates of ecosystem health. These structural indices are validated at Tall Timbers Research Station the site of one of the longest running fire ecology studies in southeastern U.S. This site is dominated by highly dynamic pine-grassland woodlands maintained with frequent fire. Once the dominant ecosystem in the Southeast, this woodland complex has been cleared for agriculture or converted to other cover types, and depends on a frequent (1- to 3-year fire return interval) low- to moderate-intensity fire regime to prevent succession to mixed hardwood forests and maintain understory species diversity. Structural evaluation of the impact of multiple disturbance regimes included height profiles and derived metrics for five different fire interval treatments; 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, mixed fire frequency (a combination of 2- and 4-year fire returns), and fire exclusion. The 3-dimensional spatial arrangement of structural elements was used to assess hardwood encroachment and changes in structural complexity. In agreement with other research, 3-year fire return interval was considered to be the best fire interval treatment for maintaining the pine-grassland woodlands, because canopy cover and vertical diversity indices were shown to be statistically higher in fire excluded and less frequently burned plots than in 1- and 2-year fire interval treatments. We developed a LiDAR-derived structural diversity index, LHDI, and propose that an ecosystem-specific threshold target for management intervention can be developed, based on significant shifts in structure and composition using this new index. Structural diversity indices can be valuable surrogates of ecosystem biodiversity, and ecosystem-specific target values can be developed as objective quantifiable goals for conservation and ecosystem integrity, particularly in remote areas.

  abstract = {ECOLECON is a spatially-explicit, object-oriented computer simulation model that simulates animal population dynamics and economic yield from timber harvests based on forest landscape structure and timber management schemes. The model has been parameterized to simulate the population dynamics and extinction probability of Rachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestiualis), a species of management concern in southeastern pine forests. Simula-tions with ECOLECON have shown that forest landscape structure and management options such as rotation lengths influence both population sizes of the sparrows and economic returns from timber harvests. Sparrow population size and economic income were often maximized by different management strategies. For example, land expectation value reached a maximum when a rotation length was 20 years; however, whenever harvest rotation length was shorter than 80 years, sparrow population size had a negative linear relationship with rotation lengths. As the amount of mature pine habitat increased, sparrow population size increased, but annual net income decreased. Fragmentation of landscapes with only a small amount of mature habitat caused lower population sizes, but fmgmentation of landscapes with a large amount of mature habitat resulted in a larger population size. Differences in placement of the mature habitat within the landscapes resulted in large differences in population size. Larger sta.nd sizes produced higher economic revenues, but the effect of stand size on population size was confounded by the amount of mature habitat. Simulation models such as ECOLECON provide a potentially powerful tool for balancing wildlife population needs and economic revenues through designing and managing forested landscapes.},

ECOLECON is a spatially-explicit individual-based, and object-oriented program. It is coded in Borland C+ + 2.0 and contains 14 classes or subclasses of ecological and economic information which are hierarchically interlinked. ECOLECON can generate artificial forest landscapes or can link with geographic information systems (GIS) to run simulations on real landscapes. The model predicts population dynamics, spatial distribution, extinction probability of a species under consideration as well as future landscape structure, and economic income from timber harvest based on current tax and timber market situation. The model outputs provide valuable information for balancing the conflicts between the generation of economic revenues and the conservation of endangered species. Because ECOLECON is interactive and easy to use, it is a useful tool for both research and education.

We monitored epiphytic lichens (notably Lobaria pulmonaria) confined to ash trees in an Estonian old-forest remnant affected by the dieback. About half of ash trees were killed in five years, during which even the abundant L pulmonaria (ca. 730 thalli on 74 trees) only produced {$<$}20 new thalli on alternative hosts. One epiphyte species disappeared and three more will probably go locally extinct in the near future. These results highlight that biodiversity risks from ash dieback can be substantial under certain conditions - when the distribution of large ash trees and their related biota have already been seriously reduced by intensive forest management. As a short-term response, we call for distinguishing and monitoring local ash-dependent epiphyte populations of broader significance and improving retention forestry practices. In the long term, silvicultural diversification should be a major tool for mitigating biodiversity risks of forest tree dieback. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Semi-natural forests, which naturally regenerate after timber harvesting, provide distinct opportunities for dead wood (DW) management for biodiversity. We described DW pool and sources of its variation during the first decade after final felling in Estonia, hemiboreal Europe. Depending on forest type, the mean post-harvest volumes of above-ground DW ranged from 70 to 119 m(3) ha(-1). Final felling generally did not reduce downed coarse woody debris (CWD) because many sawn logs were left on-site, and soil scarification was rarely used. However, subsequent decay of downed CWD appears to be accelerated due to the increased ground contact of logs, so that even the relatively small inputs from live retention trees observed (5 m(3) ha(-1) per decade) can be ecologically significant. While final felling greatly reduced snag abundance, the mortality of retained live trees generally balanced their later losses. The volumes of downed fine woody debris in conventional cutover sites were roughly double that of pre-harvest forests. Slash harvest caused an approximately twofold reduction in downed DW and resulted in CWD volumes that were below mature-forest levels. The results indicate that the habitat quality of cutovers critically depends both on the retention and on the post-harvest management of biological legacies. In Estonia, the necessary improvements include more careful retention of snags in final felling, selecting larger retention trees, focusing slash harvest on the fine debris of common tree species, and providing snags of late-successional tree species.},

Intensively managed pine supports a diverse avian assemblage potentially affected by establishment and maintenance of an annual biomass feedstock via changes in plant communities, dead wood resources, and habitat structure. We sought to understand how establishing switchgrass on an operational scale affects bird communities within intercropped plantations as compared to typical intensively managed loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest. We conducted breeding bird point counts using distance sampling for three years (2011-2013) following establishment of intercropped switchgrass stands (6 replicates), traditionally-managed pine plantations, and switchgrass-only plots (0.1km2 minimum) in Kemper Co., MS. We detected 59 breeding bird species from 11,195 detections. Neotropical migrants and forest-edge associated species were less abundant in intercropped plots than controls the first two years after establishment and more abundant in year three. Short distance migrants and residents were scarce in intercropped and control plots initially, and did not differ between these two treatments in any year. Species associated with pine-grass habitat structure were less abundant initially in intercropped plots, but converged with pine controls in subsequent years. Switchgrass monocultures provided minimal resources for birds. If songbird conservation is a management priority, managers should consider potential reductions of some breeding birds for one to two years following intercropping. It is unclear how these relationships may change outside the breeding season and as stands age. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The GAP land-cover designations are based on satellite-derived data, and although these data are widely available, these data do not capture the 3-dimensional vegetation architecture that may be important in describing vertebrate distributions. To date, no studies have examined how the inclusion of snag-or shrub-specific Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data might influence GAP model performance. The objectives of this paper were 1) to assess the performance of the National GAP models and Northwest GAP models with independently collected field data, and 2) to assess whether the inclusion of 3-dimensional vegetation data from LiDAR improved the performance of National GAP and Northwest GAP models. We included only two parameters from the LiDAR data: presence or absence of shrubs and presence or absence of snags {$>$}= 25 cm diameter at breast height. We surveyed for birds at {$>$}150 points in a 20,000-ha coniferous forest in northern Idaho and used data for eight shrub-and cavity-nesting species for validation purposes. On a guild level, National GAP models performed only marginally better than Northwest GAP models in correct classification rate, and LiDAR data did not improve vertebrate distribution models. At the scale used in this study, GAP models had poor predictive power and this is important for managers interested in using GAP models for species distributions at scales similar to ours, such as a small park or preserve,200 km(2) in size. Additionally, because the inclusion of LiDAR data did not consistently affect the performance of GAP models, future studies might consider whether LiDAR data affect GAP model performance by examining 1) different spatial scales, 2) different LiDAR metrics, and/or 3) species-specific habitat relationships not currently available in GAP models.},

Since 2002, 1214 permanent and semi-permanent plots within the PEBANPA Network have enabled researchers to monitor and assess functions and trends among vegetation parameters, biodiversity, forest dynamics, soil physicochemical characteristics, and land use management. The objectives of this manuscript are to communicate the role and rationale of the PEBANPA Network, summarize examples of the main results found within the network and provide guidance to decision makers with respect to advancing sustainable land management in southern Patagonia. As examples, rangeland health indices, seedling and sapling regeneration under different timber managed forests, litterfall and seeds production under silvopastoral use, and soil carbon content impacted by livestock grazing have all been assessed. Vegetation and environmental variables including soil respiration, soil water infiltration, soil water retention capacity, soil erosion, and litter cover were measured under different grazing intensities. Livestock and forestry production have caused changes in the original floristic patterns, with several areas experiencing desertification. Heavy stocking rates have caused the greatest impacts on grassland soil carbon (C) loss as a consequence of soil erosion. We were able to conclude that low medium grazing intensities yield the most positive impacts for biodiversity and soil physicochemical characteristics. Studies regarding levels of seedling and sapling regeneration post-harvest of timber further supported the importance of long-term monitoring due to the strongest evidence of interactions occurring 20 to 30 years after harvest. Distribution patterns of vascular plants and epigaeic coleopterons diversity revealed statistically significant differences among geographical zones and dominant vegetation types. The PEBANPA Network helps southern Patagonia address the challenges of unsustainable land management and climate change through monitoring ecosystem function and services. Long-term monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem function help decision makers better understand the impacts of land use practices, develop well-informed policies and secure present and future human well-being.

  abstract = {South American forests contain a large fraction of the world's biodiversity, but it is obvious that if current trends of deforestation continue unchanged over the next decades, native forests will decline to an unacceptable levels. A landscape perspective to sustainable forest management and conservation provides a holistic framework to build up future research and tools towards an adaptive forest management approach to preserve forest biodiversity value while promoting the sustainable use of these forests. In this chapter we stress the importance of a landscape ecology perspective towards managing forests. We focus mainly on the temperate forests of Argentina and Chile, but within a broader framework of other forests in the South American region. An overview of threats to native forests is presented, and then new perspectives of conservation and management alternatives are analyzed. Our aim is to provide specific examples where a landscape ecology holistic approach contributes to integrating biodiversity value with the need for forestry activities, and provide insights into forest conservation and management initiatives, comparing traditional and timber-oriented management with new emerging approaches, including contributions of a landscape ecology perspective.},

  abstract = {The growing need to manage vegetation resources at regional and global spatial scales has led to the increased use of remote sensing technologies among forestry scientists and managers for use in their investigation and supervision of forested landscapes. With an array of extant and developing airborne and satellite sensors, as well as multiple analysis techniques, there is a need to discern the most acceptable methods with which to examine remotely sensed imagery for forest ecosystem parameters. We have reviewed the literature on the remote sensing of boreal forests in order to determine if common frameworks for monitoring and assessing change in forest biophysical and inventory parameters could be developed. Other important remote sensing techniques such as those for change detection and land cover identification were also examined. Our review examined studies documented within the scientific literature that involved the extraction of information on forest parameters with remote sensing instruments. Primarily, we focused on studies within the boreal forest, which plays an important part in the Earth-atmosphere system and contributes significantly to the global economy through forest-derived products and resources. Additionally, the boreal forest has served as the primary investigation site for many important forest remote sensing discoveries. In this review, we considered the forest parameter that was examined, the remote sensing platform used, and the calibration and validation accuracies for the study. The most effective methodology for examining each parameter, considering spatial scale, is described. In general, a fusion of multiple sensors provided the most accurate approach for parameter extraction; however, this may not be the most appropriate methodology for all studies, due to spatial and temporal considerations. In each case, we attempted to consider which methodology works the best in a variety of scenarios. \textcopyright{} 2008 Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute.},

  abstract = {It is well known that related species often differ in either habitat' or size, and thereby avoid competitive elimination. The way in which they differ is related to the specialized ways they have of using resources, which ways in turn control numbers of coexisting species and other aspects of the evolution of the comnmunity. The detailed reasons for these assertions are given in the following paragraphs.2 Briefly, the argument is as follows. Among species which specialize on a single uniform resource, only the most effective one will survive and that species will be found wherever the resource occurs, in abundance determined by the density of the resource. Other such pure specialist species will be found, one to a uniform resource; these will normally differ in morphology, but will not in general be affected by one another's distributions. On the other hand, species which specialize on a particular proportion of mixture of two or more particular resources will be found only where their favored proportion is found, and will be replaced by other species in other habitats where the proportion of the mixture changes to one on which the new species are more effective. Of this mixed-resource type of species there can be as many3 as there are proportions of the resources which can be counted on from season to season-i.e., very many in stable climates and fewer in unpredictable climates.},

  abstract = {Sustainable forest management (SFM) is many things to many people - yet a common thread is the production of forest goods and services for the present and future generations. The promise of sustainability is rooted in the two premises; first that ecosystems have the potential to renew themselves and second that economic activities and social perceptions or values that define human interaction with the environment are choices that can be modified to ensure the long term productivity and health of the ecosystem. SFM addresses a great challenge in matching the increasing demands of a growing human population while maintaining ecological functions of healthy forest ecosystems. This paper does not seek to define SFM, but rather provides analyses of key indicators for the national-scale enabling environment to gain a global insight into progress in implementing enabling and implementing SFM at the national and operational levels. Analyses of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA) country report data are used to provide insights into the current state of progress in implementing the enabling conditions for SFM. Over 2.17 billion ha of the world's forest area are predicted by governments to remain in permanent forest land use, of which some 1.1 billion ha are covered by all of the SFM tools investigated in FRA 2015. At the global scale, SFM-related policies and regulations are reported to be in place on 97\% of global forest area. While the number of countries with national forest inventories has increased over that past ten years from 48 to 112, only 37\% of forests in low income countries are covered by forest inventories. Forest management planning and monitoring of plans has increased substantially as has forest management certification, which exceeded a total of over 430 million ha in 2014. However, 90\% of internationally verified certification is in the boreal and temperate climatic domains - only 6\% of permanent forests in the tropical domain have been certified as of 2014. Results show that more work is needed to expand the extent and depth of work on establishing the enabling conditions that support SFM over the long term and suggests where those needs are greatest.},

As part of the Stuart-Takla Fisheries-Forestry Interaction Project, we have investigated the influence of three variable-retention riparian harvesting prescriptions on temperatures in first-order streams in the interior sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Prescriptions were designed to represent a range of possible harvesting options outlined by the Forest Practices Code of B.C., or associated best management practice guidelines. Five years after the completion of harvesting treatments, temperatures remained four to six degrees warmer, and diurnal temperature variation remained higher than in the control streams regardless of treatment. Initially, the high-retention treatment acted to mitigate the temperature effects of the harvesting, but 3 successive years of windthrow was antecedent to reduced canopy density and equivalent temperature impacts. We speculate that late autumn reversals in the impacts of forest harvesting also occur. Temperature impacts in this study remained within the tolerance limits of local biota. However, even modest temperature changes could alter insect production, egg incubation, fish rearing, migration timing, and susceptibility to disease, and the effects of large changes to daily temperature range are not well understood.},

Broadleaf-dominated forests differed from mixedwood or conifer-dominated forests in that they had greater canopy cover, litter depth, soil nitrogen, warmer soils, as well as greater shrub cover, herb and shrub richness and diversity (plot scale). In contrast, conifer, and to a lesser extent mixedwood, forest had greater beta diversity than broadleaf forest. Overall, mixedwood and conifer forests were similar to one another, both differed from broadleaf forest. Several species were found to be significant indicators of broadleaf forest but most of these also occurred in the other forest types. Understory composition was related to canopy composition and edaphic conditions. Variable-retention harvesting had little effect on understory cover, richness, or diversity but resulted in reduced richness and beta diversity at a larger scale. The clearcut and 20\% treatments affected composition in all forest types. Early successional species and those common in disturbed sites were indicators of harvesting while evergreen, shade-tolerant understory herbs were indicators of the control forest and 75\% retention harvest. We conclude that it is important to maintain a range of variation in canopy composition of mixedwood forests in order to conserve the associated understory communities. The presence of conifers in these forests has a particularly important influence on understory communities. The threshold for a lifeboat effect of variable-retention harvesting is between 20 and 75\% retention. Examination of richness and beta diversity at a variety of scales can provide interesting information on effects of harvesting on spatial reorganization and homogenization of understory plant communities.

Here we apply this modeling approach to data collected on terrestrial salamanders in the Plethodon glutinosus complex in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA, and wish to address the question "how accurately does the fitted model represent the data?" The goodness-of-fit of the model needs to be assessed in order to make accurate inferences. This article presents a method where a simple Pearson chi-square statistic is calculated and a parametric bootstrap procedure is used to determine whether the observed statistic is unusually large. We found evidence that the most global model considered provides a poor fit to the data, hence estimated an overdispersion factor to adjust model selection procedures and inflate standard errors. Two hypothetical datasets with known assumption violations are also analyzed, illustrating that the method may be used to guide researchers to making appropriate inferences. The results of a simulation study are presented to provide a broader view of the methods properties.},

We characterized the community structure and niche characteristics (niche position, marginality, breadth) of upland and lowland boreal birds at scales relevant to both natural and human disturbance patterns in western boreal forests undergoing rapid and extensive multi-sector resource development. Our goal was to identify the degree of ecological specialization in order to inform activities directed at conserving a diversity of species (e.g. specialists and generalists) within the western boreal bird community. We used avian data ({$>$}5,220 point counts) and environmental variable data comprised of forest composition, stand, and landscape pattern metrics at local (7.1. ha), landscape (1,963. ha), and regional (11,310. ha) scales to determine boreal bird distribution and community-level associations using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. OMI analysis explained a high proportion of variance in the dataset (71.8\%) and separated boreal birds along two axes associated with moisture-productivity and age-structural complexity gradients. Niche position was influenced by local scale variables (height, age, area of mature-old forest, area of wet soil types), but also landscape and regional scale variables (total area of hardwood and conifer, mean nearest neighbour distance of conifer, and total core area of productive upland conifer). Only 15 of 67 species (22\%) had marginal (atypical) niches and narrow niche breadths exhibiting specialization in old hardwood and white spruce forests and burned, open, and lowland habitats. Most species occupied typical or common habitats within the study area and exhibited generalist strategies typical of species in heterogeneous and disturbed habitats that undergo frequent change. Our results suggest the need to design and implement multi-species plans to conserve a diversity of western boreal bird species (e.g. specialists and generalists) at the regional scale.},

  abstract = {Monitoring wetland as one of the important parts of the global ecosystem is necessary for conservational programs. But, usually, collecting in situ data is restricted in these areas because of their remote locations, vast area and dynamic conditions. Remote sensing provides a cost effective tool to investigate hydrological patterns and the seasonal trend of changes in wetlands. In this paper, Land-use/land-cover change during water inundation period of Hamun wetland was investigated in order to determine change trend during this period. Hamun wetland is an unsustainable ecosystem, and monitoring this wetland is essential for conservation goals. This trend is critical for decision makers in order to plan the conservational scheme in all unsustainable ecosystems. To reach this objective, the land-use/land-cover maps during inundation period of Hamun were produced using Landsat 8 time series images. The results of accuracy assessment showed the classification of water and vegetation have the highest accuracy (94\% and 93\%, respectively). And the accuracy of plants in the water classes was the lowest (water-veg=89.9\%, veg-water 1=88.8\%, veg-water 2=87.6\%). This means the higher misclassification is in determining the vegetation in the water. Then, the changes in the land-cover classes in relation to wetland inundation were investigated. Results of land-use/land-cover change illustrate the regions that were suitable for water birds but lost their suitability when the wetland dried out. These areas are crucial for water bird's conservation. Satellite data determined these areas with acceptable accuracy.},

Full-waveform lidar data give more control to an end user in the interpretation process of the physical measurement and provide additional information about the structure and the physical backscattering characteristics of the illuminated surfaces. In this paper, the theoretical principles of full-waveform airborne laser scanning are first described. Afterwards, a review of the main sensors as well as signal processing techniques are presented. We then discuss the interpretation of full-waveform measures with special interest on vegetated and urban areas. (c) 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

  abstract = {Adequate connectivity between discontinuous habitat patches is crucial for the persistence of metapopulations across space and time. Loss of landscape connectivity is often a direct result of fragmentation caused by human activities but also can be caused indirectly through anthropogenic climate change. Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) are widely dispersed across the islands of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and rely on sea ice to move seasonally between island habitats throughout their range. Seasonal connectivity provided by sea ice is necessary to maintain genetic diversity and to facilitate dispersal and recolonization of areas from which caribou have been extirpated. We used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to model connectivity across Peary caribou range, and future climate projections to investigate how this connectivity might be affected by a warming climate. Further, we used measures of current flow centrality to estimate the role of High Arctic islands in maintaining connectivity between Peary caribou populations and to identify and prioritize those islands and linkages most important for conservation. Our results suggest that the Bathurst Island complex plays a critical role in facilitating connectivity between Peary caribou populations. Large islands, including Banks, Victoria, and Ellesmere have limited roles in connecting Peary caribou. Without rigorous greenhouse gas emission reductions our projections indicate that by 2100 all connectivity between the more southern Peary caribou populations will be lost for important spring and early-winter movement periods. Continued connectivity across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and possibly Peary caribou persistence, ultimately hinges on global commitments to limit climate change. Our research highlights priority areas where, in addition to emission reductions, conservation efforts to maintain connectivity would be most effective.},

  abstract = {We present the results of, to our knowledge, the first Lidar study applied to continuous and simultaneous monitoring of aerial insects, bats and birds. It illustrates how common patterns of flight activity, e.g. insect swarming around twilight, depend on predation risk and other constraints acting on the faunal components. Flight activity was monitored over a rice field in China during one week in July 2016, using a high-resolution Scheimpflug Lidar system. The monitored Lidar transect was about 520m long and covered approximately 2.5m(3). The observed biomass spectrum was bimodal, and targets were separated into insects and vertebrates in a categorization supported by visual observations. Peak flight activity occurred at dusk and dawn, with a 37 min time difference between the bat and insect peaks. Hence, bats started to feed in declining insect activity after dusk and stopped before the rise in activity before dawn. A similar time difference between insects and birds may have occurred, but it was not obvious, perhaps because birds were relatively scarce. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that flight activity of bats is constrained by predation in bright light, and that crepuscular insects exploit this constraint by swarming near to sunset/sunrise to minimize predation from bats.},

Total volume stock and timber production change according to site quality, occupation degree, growth development phases and management history of the stands. The aim of this work was to evaluate the yield of three different logging systems (short-logs, long-logs and full stems) under a shelterwood cut system of N. pumilio forest growing at a middle site quality stand in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina). Sample plots were obtained in an old-growth two strata stand (3.0 ha) with abundant regeneration (stand density index of 93.8-113.4 \%). Total volumes per hectare varied between 726.5 and 850.3 m(3) ha(-1). The volume/basal area ratio varied from 11.8 to 12.1 m(3) m(-2). Yield indexes obtained were 45.5 \% for full stems, 21.3 \% for long-logs and 22.4 \% for short-logs logging systems. A model performed to estimate the timber volume for each system shows that full stems is significantly different from the other two. Several studies related to timber production were compared and discussed. Thus, applying full stems system results in a higher timber volume. Considering new alternatives in the planning of N. pumilio forests allows for higher harvest rates, increasing profits for the forestry company and minimizing the damage to the forest.},

  abstract = {Reliable estimation of the size or density of wild animal populations is very important for effective wildlife management, conservation and ecology. Currently, the most widely used methods for obtaining such estimates involve either sighting animals from transect lines or some form of capture-recapture on marked or uniquely identifiable individuals. However, many species are difficult to sight, and cannot be easily marked or recaptured. Some of these species produce readily identifiable sounds, providing an opportunity to use passive acoustic data to estimate animal density. In addition, even for species for which other visually based methods are feasible, passive acoustic methods offer the potential for greater detection ranges in some environments (e.g. underwater or in dense forest), and hence potentially better precision. Automated data collection means that surveys can take place at times and in places where it would be too expensive or dangerous to send human observers. Here, we present an overview of animal density estimation using passive acoustic data, a relatively new and fast-developing field. We review the types of data and methodological approaches currently available to researchers and we provide a framework for acoustics-based density estimation, illustrated with examples from real-world case studies. We mention moving sensor platforms (e.g. towed acoustics), but then focus on methods involving sensors at fixed locations, particularly hydrophones to survey marine mammals, as acoustic-based density estimation research to date has been concentrated in this area. Primary among these are methods based on distance sampling and spatially explicit capture-recapture. The methods are also applicable to other aquatic and terrestrial sound-producing taxa. We conclude that, despite being in its infancy, density estimation based on passive acoustic data likely will become an important method for surveying a number of diverse taxa, such as sea mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and insects, especially in situations where inferences are required over long periods of time. There is considerable work ahead, with several potentially fruitful research areas, including the development of (i) hardware and software for data acquisition, (ii) efficient, calibrated, automated detection and classification systems, and (iii) statistical approaches optimized for this application. Further, survey design will need to be developed, and research is needed on the acoustic behaviour of target species. Fundamental research on vocalization rates and group sizes, and the relation between these and other factors such as season or behaviour state, is critical. Evaluation of the methods under known density scenarios will be important for empirically validating the approaches presented here. \textcopyright{} 2012 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

  abstract = {We argue for expanding the role of theory in ecology to accelerate scientific progress, enhance the ability to address environmental challenges, foster the development of synthesis and unification, and improve the design of experiments and large-scale environmental-monitoring programs. To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data. We contend that the development and successive refinement of efficient theories provide a solid foundation for advancing environmental science in the era of big data. Keywords: theory unification, metabolic theory, neutral theory of biodiversity, maximum entropy theory of ecology, big data The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms. (Albert Einstein) Science is intended to deepen our understanding of the natural world. Progress in science arises from the tension between induction and deduction, empiricism and theory. Data gathered through observation and experimentation provide clues about the structure and function of the natural world, and theory organizes existing data and new ideas into a cohesive conceptual framework to both explain existing observations and make novel predictions. Theory reduces the apparent complexity of the natural world, because it captures essential features of a system, provides abstracted characterizations , and makes predictions for as-yet unobserved phenomena that additional data can be used to test. There are many ideas about the nature of theory in science and in philosophy (Nagel 1961, NRC 2008). In ecology, there is currently no consensus regarding the definition, role, and generality of theories, which is discussed in several essays (e.g., Pickett et al. 1994, Scheiner and Willig 2011). It is not surprising that ecologists use the label theory to refer to many things. Meanings of theory range from highly specific to very general, from hypotheses (e.g., the hypothesis of clutch overlap or the intermediate disturbance hypothesis) to conceptual frameworks for complete fields or research programs (e.g., macroecology, conservation biology). A survey of the ecological literature finds reference to 78 theories (see supplemental table S1), almost half of which have been mentioned in more than two publications (figure 1, table S1), which suggests that ecology is awash with theories. But is ecology theory rich? Are there different types of theories in ecology, with different precepts and goals? What theories constitute a foundational conceptual framework for building a more predictive, quantitative, and useful science of ecology? A field with a large and diverse number of theories may be a healthy one, but this can also hamper progress; stifle innovation; and lead to inadequate policy to manage, mitigate, and adapt to undesirable environmental impacts. A discussion of the different types of theories in ecology is a timely and necessary exercise. Here, we define a theory as a hierarchical framework that contains clearly formulated postulates, based on a minimal set of assumptions, from which a set of predictions logically follows. Theory is inherently deductive. Advances in data stimulate theory, and new theory refines, expands, and replaces old theory, thereby correcting flaws and explaining and predicting phenomena in the domain in which they apply. As such, the evolution of a successful theory is for it to become more general, through the development of detailed models that apply the theory to a wider class of phenomena. Is ecology theory rich? The richness of theories in ecology is, to some degree, illusory. As was mentioned above, several "theories" (see table S1) are actually specific hypotheses or models. Ecologists and other scientists often use the terms model and theory indistinguishably (e.g., Leijonhufvud 1997, Ginzburg and Jensen 2004), but they are fundamentally different. Models are BioScience 64: 701-710.},

  abstract = {Forest management globally affects the ecosystem services, especially those related to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation, by altering forest structure and composition. The degree of alteration was related to the intensity and type of harvesting; therefore, the major silvicultural challenge is to develop alternatives to mitigate climate change and maintain forest functions and biodiversity while also providing acceptable levels of timber production. Variable retention forestry (VRF) is a highly flexible concept, with continuity of forest cover, structure, function, and species composition, thereby supporting multiple economic, environmental, and cultural goals. This special issue provides an overview of the concepts and applications related to VRF implementation around the world. It shows that VRF has been applied globally for several decades, with varying levels and retention types, depending on local conditions and the economic importance of forestry. The challenges of VRF seem to differ to some extent on different continents, yet the general aims have been accepted in most of the continents. VRF has been successful in mitigating many effects of intensive harvesting, though in some forests of the world, the retention levels are too low to maintain acceptable levels of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. We conclude that an active collaboration between scientists and forest practitioners is needed to realize all of the opportunities provided by VRF in solving global forestry-related issues.},

  abstract = {The current silvicultural prescriptions for Nothofagus are designed to stimulate natural regeneration by opening the canopy. One of these methods is variable retention, which can include either or both aggregated and dispersed retention. Different degrees of retention may modify microclimatic variables differently and consequently offer dissimilar microenvironmental conditions for regeneration. Retained canopy influences both biotic and abiotic factors. The objective was to evaluate Nothofagus pumilio regeneration along edge-related gradients within aggregated retention, and in the different microenvironments within the harvested areas. The remnant canopy cover after harvesting greatly influenced regeneration mainly by decreasing radiation transmittance and soil moisture availability. Aspect (direction to the azimuth) and distance from edge of aggregates influenced regeneration density, height and growth. In dispersed retention, microenvironments generated by different types of understory plant cover, debris, and proximity of remnant trees also influenced regeneration. High levels of understory cover (up 50\%) and medium levels of harvesting debris cover (25-50\%) had a positive impact, while close proximity to remnant trees had a negative impact on regeneration. These findings can be used to improve silvicultural and harvesting prescriptions to ensure successful establishment of regeneration and maximize potential growth. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional silviculture, such as shelterwood cuts (SC), transforms uneven-aged original stands to an even-aged managed forest. Recently, other methods have proposed to conserve some of the original heterogeneity of the old-growth forests. One proposal leaves 30\% of the timber quality forest area as aggregated retention and 20\% basal area as dispersed retention. The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of timber management with aggregated and dispersed retention in Nothofagus pumilio old-growth forests by analyzing timber and harvesting yield potential compared with traditional regeneration systems. Also, remnant tree stability of aggregated retention was analyzed. Timber yield potential of old-growth forests varied from 136 to 479 m(3) ha(-1) across a site quality gradient. High grading cutting improved yield index (timber volume and harvested basal area (HBA) ratio of 7.9 m(3) m(-2)). In contrast, this index decreased in clear-cuts (4.7 m(3) m(-2)) and shelterwood cuts (4.9 m(3) m(-2) The index also decreased in the aggregated and dispersed retention treatment (5.1 m(3) m(-2) but with higher timber harvested volumes. Windthrow of remaining trees in aggregated retention was related to time, being significantly higher during the first year after harvesting. Windthrow was affected by crown class and position into the aggregates of the remnant trees as well as site quality of the stand. Regeneration methods with aggregated retention were feasible across the entire site quality gradient, and economic losses were not significant when compared to shelterwood cuts. The method also resulted in stability of the remnant overstory, which maintained the ecological conditions to ensure biodiversity conservation and continuity of harvested stands.

However, the rates, causes, and consequences of postharvest mortality (PHM) have rarely been investigated in commonly used silvicultural systems. We applied a chronosequence approach combined with tree-ring-based dating of mortality events to investigate PHM following single-tree selection silviculture in a hardwood forest in central Ontario, Canada. Observed rates of PHM were best described by a negative exponential model, with an initial peak of 0.78-0.94\% year(-1) occurring within the first two years postharvest, and decreasing to similar to 0.55\% year(-1) three through five years postharvest. At six through 10 years postharvest, observed tree mortality was stable at similar to 0.21\% year(-1): these rates were considerably lower than those observed in unmanaged stands at the same site (0.96\% year(-1)). Trees {$<$}= 17 cm in diameter were most susceptible to PHM, as were two soft-wood species (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss and Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and Betula alleghaniensis Brit. Acer saccharum Marsh. and Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. were least susceptible. Causes and types of mortality changed significantly with time after harvest: initially, mechanical damage from skidding and felling resulted in most dead trees observed as downed wood. With time, biotic agents (fungal infections, senescence) became more prevalent agents of mortality, increasing the proportions of standing dead trees. Our results indicate that PHM rates following selection harvesting are small compared to those following other retention harvest systems, but in the long term disproportionate effects on certain species are likely to affect the structure and function of managed northern hardwood forests.

  abstract = {The lack of maps depicting forest three-dimensional structure, particularly as pertaining to snags and understory shrub species distribution, is a major limitation for managing wildlife habitat in forests. Developing new techniques to remotely map snags and understory shrubs is therefore an important need. To address this, we first evaluated the use of LiDAR data for mapping the presence/absence of understory shrub species and different snag diameter classes important for birds (i.e. {$\geq$} 15 cm, {$\geq$} 25 cm and {$\geq$} 30 cm) in a 30,000 ha mixed-conifer forest in Northern Idaho (USA). We used forest inventory plots, LiDAR-derived metrics, and the Random Forest algorithm to achieve classification accuracies of 83\% for the understory shrubs and 86\% to 88\% for the different snag diameter classes. Second, we evaluated the use of LiDAR data for mapping wildlife habitat suitability using four avian species (one flycatcher and three woodpeckers) as case studies. For this, we integrated LiDAR-derived products of forest structure with available models of habitat suitability to derive a variety of species-habitat associations (and therefore habitat suitability patterns) across the study area. We found that the value of LiDAR resided in the ability to quantify 1) ecological variables that are known to influence the distribution of understory vegetation and snags, such as canopy cover, topography, and forest succession, and 2) direct structural metrics that indicate or suggest the presence of shrubs and snags, such as the percent of vegetation returns in the lower strata of the canopy (for the shrubs) and the vertical heterogeneity of the forest canopy (for the snags). When applied to wildlife habitat assessment, these new LiDAR-based maps refined habitat predictions in ways not previously attainable using other remote sensing technologies. This study highlights new value of LiDAR in characterizing key forest structure components important for wildlife, and warrants further applications to other forested environments and wildlife species. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {For better or worse, in those parts of the world with a widespread farming, livestock rising, and urban expansion, the maintenance of species richness and ecosystem services cannot depend only upon protected natural sites. Can they rely on a network of cultural landscapes endowed with their own associated biodiversity? We analyze the effects of land-cover change on landscape ecological patterns and processes that sustain bird species richness associated to cropland-grassland landscapes in the Great Plains-Denver metropolitan edge. Our purpose is to assess the potential contribution to bird biodiversity maintenance of Great Plain's cropland-grassland mosaics kept as farmland green belts in the edge of metropolitan areas. We present a quantitative landscape ecology assessment of land-cover changes (1930-2010) experienced in five Great Plains counties in Colorado. Several landscape metrics assess the diversity of land-cover patterns and their impact on ecological connectivity indices. These metrics are applied to historical land-cover maps and datasets drawn from aerial photos and satellite imagery. The results show that the cropland-grassland mosaics that link the metropolitan edge with the surrounding habitats sheltered in less human-disturbed areas provide a heterogeneous land matrix were a high bird species richness exists. They also suggest that keeping multifunctional farmland-grassland green belts near the edge of metropolitan areas may provide important ecosystem services, supplementing traditional conservation policies. Our maps and indicators can be used for selecting certain types of landscape patterns and priority areas on which biodiversity conservation efforts and land-use planning can concentrate.},

  abstract = {One of the objectives of forest conservation is the set aside of unharvested areas. However, the fragmentation and lack of connectivity of protected areas make the integration of conservation measures in productive forests essential. Strategies to integrate conservation of saproxylic biodiversity in forest management have been developed, but often considering only specific aspects or remaining preliminary otherwise. As the impact of climate change and anthropogenic stresses increases, the development and the synthesis of this approach is crucial. We reviewed the key literature on forest management for biodiversity conservation, integrating forest science perspective to provide a practical management framework. Our goal is to present a management framework that could contribute to the effective preservation of forest insect biodiversity at the landscape scale, without high economic efforts, and addressing the conflicts that still jeopardize sustainable forest management. The results of our review support the creation of micro-reserves inside productive forests, to support large reserves in landscape conservation strategies. Micro-reserves increase the resilience of forest ecosystems to anthropogenic disturbances, through the development of a heterogeneous structure, maximizing microhabitat availability. Modeling forest management and harvest on local natural disturbance would extend the benefits of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in productive forests. Variable retention harvest systems, applied at the landscape scale, are a feasible and adaptable strategy to preserve and increase biodiversity, safeguarding structural legacies such as senescent trees and deadwood inside the productive matrix. The operational shift, from the stand to the forest landscape, is fundamental to extend the benefits of conservation measures. The Forest Biodiversity Artery, composed by several micro-reserves or ilots de senescence, connected by corridors of habitat trees and deadwood, constitutes a network that would deliver old-growth forests attributes to the productive matrix. This planning instrument would support forest connectivity, and socioeconomic constraints.},

Predictive models based on underpinning relationships between environmental predictors and the individual organism are likely to require measurement of spatially fine-grained predictor variables. Further, models must show spatial generality if they are to be used to predict the consequences of habitat change over large geographical areas. Remote sensing techniques using airborne scanning laser altimetry (LiDAR) and high resolution multi-spectral imagery allow spatially fine-grained predictor variables to be measured over large geographical areas and thus facilitate testing of the spatial generality of organism-habitat models. These techniques are considered using the skylark as an example species. A range image segmentation system for LiDAR data is described which allows measurement of skylark habitat predictor variables such as within-field vegetation height, boundary height and shape for individual fields within the LiDAR image. Additional variables such as field vegetation type and fractional vegetation ground cover may be obtained from co-registered multi-spectral data. These techniques could have wide application in testing the generality of relationships between populations and habitats, and in ecological monitoring of change in habitat structures and the associated effects on wildlife, over large geographical areas.},

In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the \textasciitilde 552millionha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a {$>$}25,000km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on {$>$}80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.},

The committee thought it was feasible to have their paid survey crews collect the data in this manner but asked BAM to first more clearly articulate why they needed these data and how much data would be required. In this white paper we address this request.  The additional data from the 2 x 2 design will help us (1) measure roadside bias in avian surveys and thereby allow us to combine data from roadside and off-road surveys in our analyses of distribution and abundance and (2) control for differences in detectability among habitats for a wider array of species and habitat types.  A general summary of the BAM data indicated that if atlas crews were able to conduct surveys at 1,000\textendash 2,000 points following the 2 x 2 design, then we would be able to correct these data for detectability for 36\textendash 49 species of passerines.  The number of surveys needed to compute detection rates of species at risk are reduced if wetlands},

Multiple factors could explain species distributions including endogenous evolutionary traits leading to conspecific clustering and endogenous habitat features that support life history requirements. Birds are a useful taxon for examining hypotheses about the relative importance of these factors among species in a community. We developed a hierarchical Bayes approach to model the relationships between bird species occupancy and local landcover variables accounting for spatial autocorrelation, species similarities, and partial observability. We fit alternative occupancy models to detections of 90 bird species observed during repeat visits to 316 point-counts forming a 400-m grid throughout the Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge in Maryland, USA. Models with landcover variables performed significantly better than our autologistic and null models, supporting the hypothesis that local landcover heterogeneity is important as an exogenous driver for species distributions. Conspecific clustering alone was a comparatively poor descriptor of local community composition, but there was evidence for spatial autocorrelation in all species. Considerable uncertainty remains whether landcover combined with spatial autocorrelation is most parsimonious for describing bird species distributions at a local scale. Spatial structuring may be weaker at intermediate scales within which dispersal is less frequent, information flows are localized, and landcover types become spatially diversified and therefore exhibit little aggregation. Examining such hypotheses across species assemblages contributes to our understanding of community-level associations with conspecifics and landscape composition.},

Caused by the death of individual or multiple trees with subsequent fall from the canopy, gaps have been extensively studied in temperate deciduous and tropical forests for the past 20 years.

Because of the ubiquity of large-scale, stand-initiating disturbances such as landscape-level fires, epidemic insect outbreaks, and periodic extensive windthrow events, gap processes in boreal forests have received little attention. Research in the Scandinavian and Russian boreal forest, as well as in high-altitude boreal "outliers" found in Japan and the United States, is showing that gap disturbance determines forest structure and processes to a greater extent than previously assumed. Boreal forests dominated by the shade-tolerant fir (Abies) - spruce (Picea) complex are particularly well-adapted to the development of long-term, old-growth continuity in the absence of large-scale disturbance.},

We appraised three environmental data sources that represent options often available to researchers and managers in wildlife ecological studies: (i) a pre-existing forest inventory; (ii) a general-purpose, single-attribute remote sensing land cover map; and (iii) a specific-purpose, multi-attribute remote sensing database. The three information sources were evaluated with two complementary analyses: the first designed to appraise levels of map quality (assessed on the basis of accuracy, vagueness, completion, consistency, level of measurement, and detail) and the second designed to assess their relative capacity to explain patterns of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) telemetry locations across a 100,000-km2 study area in west-central Alberta, Canada. We found the forest inventory database to be reasonably functional in its ability to support resource selection analysis in regions where coverage was available, but overall, the data suffered from quality issues related to completeness accuracy, and consistency. The general-purpose remote sensing land cover product ranked higher in terms of overall map quality, but demonstrated a lower capacity for explaining observed patterns of grizzly bear habitat use. We found the best results using the specific-purpose, multi-attribute remote sensing database, and recommend that similar information sources be used as the foundation for wildlife habitat studies whenever possible, particularly those involving large areas that span jurisdictional boundaries.},

  abstract = {Accurate spatial information on the distribution of whitebark pine, a keystone species in alpine environments across western Canada, is critical for the planning of conservation activities designed to ameliorate the damaging effects of blister rust, mountain pine beetle, and interspecific competition. We compared classification tree analysis and logistic regression analysis to explore their relative abilities to model whitebark pine presence and absence with medium-spatial-resolution satellite and topographic variables across a complex study site in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta. Both techniques were found to be effective, generating map products of roughly equal thematic quality (91\% overall accuracy; kappa = 0.76). However, the logistic model was valuable in its ability to predict ratio-level probability surfaces, whereas the classification tree approach was simpler, faster, and found to generate a slightly more balanced model from an individual class accuracy perspective.

Few models designed for conservation purposes are validated with real-world data, and such models are even less likely to be revisited and improved with post-implemen-tation results. We test the performance of a model frequently used and heavily relied-upon for the man-agement of the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). The RCW Foraging Matrix Application incorporates spatially-explicit forest stand data and woodpecker territory locations to pro-duce quantitative assessments of foraging habitat quality. Model parameters were based on expert opin-ion and research performed on several key populations at a time when range-wide habitat quality was relatively poor. Since the model's inception, many red-cockaded woodpecker populations have been monitored intensely in restored habitat, providing an opportunity to evaluate model performance range-wide. We assessed the relationship of habitat quality, as measured by the RCW Matrix Application, to group size and fledgling production from populations across the species range in the southeastern Uni-ted States. We also evaluated foraging habitat quality directly by relating woodpecker fitness compo-nents to foraging habitat metrics through regression tree analyses. Results showed that some, but not all, of the habitat metrics included in the RCW Matrix Application were consistently related to fitness components range-wide, but threshold values for these habitat metrics identified by regression tree anal-yses were site-specific rather than universal. Our findings indicate opportunities for improving on ''one-size-fits-all'' range-wide models with analyses of additional locally-relevant foraging habitat metrics.},

As a result, governmental and non-governmental organizations are focusing efforts to map and conserve areas that facilitate movement to maintain population connectivity and promote climate adaptation. In contrast, little focus has been placed on identifying barriers-landscape features which impede movement between ecologically important areas-where restoration could most improve connectivity. Yet knowing where barriers most strongly reduce connectivity can complement traditional analyses aimed at mapping best movement routes. We introduce a novel method to detect important barriers and provide example applications. Our method uses GIS neighborhood analyses in conjunction with effective distance analyses to detect barriers that, if removed, would significantly improve connectivity. Applicable in least-cost, circuit-theoretic, and simulation modeling frameworks, the method detects both complete (impermeable) barriers and those that impede but do not completely block movement. Barrier mapping complements corridor mapping by broadening the range of connectivity conservation alternatives available to practitioners. The method can help practitioners move beyond maintaining currently important areas to restoring and enhancing connectivity through active barrier removal. It can inform decisions on trade-offs between restoration and protection; for example, purchasing an intact corridor may be substantially more costly than restoring a barrier that blocks an alternative corridor. And it extends the concept of centrality to barriers, highlighting areas that most diminish connectivity across broad networks. Identifying which modeled barriers have the greatest impact can also help prioritize error checking of land cover data and collection of field data to improve connectivity maps. Barrier detection provides a different way to view the landscape, broadening thinking about connectivity and fragmentation while increasing conservation options. \textcopyright{} 2012 McRae et al.},

  abstract = {In North America, different strains of the Lyme disease-causing bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto cluster into phylogenetic groups that are associated with different levels of pathogenicity and, for some, specific rodent reservoir hosts. Here we explore whether landscape connectivity, by impacting host dispersal, influences B. burgdorferi s.s. spread patterns. This question is central to modelling spatial patterns of the spread of Lyme disease risk in the zone of northward range-expansion of B. burgdorferi s.s. in southeastern Canada where the study was conducted. We used multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to characterise B. burgdorferi s.s. in positive ticks collected at 13 sites in southern Quebec, Canada during the early stages of B. burgdorferi s.s. invasion. We used mixed effects logistic regression to investigate whether landscape connectivity (probability of connectivity; PC) affected the probability that samples collected at different sites were of the same strain (MLST sequence type: ST). PC was calculated from a habitat map based on high spatial resolution (15 m) Landsat 8 imagery to identify woodland habitat that are preferred by rodent hosts of B. burgdorferi s.s. There was a significant positive association between the likelihood that two samples were of the same ST and PC, when PC values were grouped into three categories of low, medium and high. When analysing data for individual STs, samples at different sites were significantly more likely to be the same when PC was higher for the rodent-associated ST1. These findings support the hypothesis that dispersion trajectories of B. burgdorferi s.s. in general, and some rodent-associated strains in particular, are at least partly determined by landscape connectivity. This may suggest that dispersion of B. burgdorferi s.s. is more common by terrestrial mammal hosts (which would likely disperse according to landscape connectivity) than by birds, the dispersal of which is likely less constrained by landscape. This study suggests that accounting for landscape connectivity may improve model-based predictions of spatial spread patterns of B. burgdorferi s.s. The findings are consistent with possible past dispersal patterns of B. burgdorferi s.s. as determined by phylogeographic studies.},

  abstract = {Wind is one of the most important natural disturbances influencing forest structure, ecosystem function, and successional processes worldwide. This study quantifies the stand-scale effects of intermediate-severity windstorms (i.e., blowdowns) on (1) live and dead legacy structure, (2) aboveground carbon storage, and (3) tree regeneration and associated stand dynamics at four mature, mixed hardwood-conifer forest sites in the northeastern United States. We compare wind-affected forests to adjacent reference conditions (i.e., undisturbed portions of the same stands) 0-8yr post-blowdown using parametric (ANOVA) and nonparametric (NMS ordination) analyses. We supplement inventory plots and downed coarse woody detritus (DCWD) transects with hemispherical photography to capture spatial variation in the light environment. Although recent blowdowns transferred a substantial proportion of live overstory trees to DCWD, residual live tree basal area was high (19-59\% of reference areas). On average, the initial post-blowdown ratio of DCWD carbon to standing live tree carbon was 2.72 in blowdown stands and 0.18 in reference stands, indicating a large carbon transfer from live to dead pools. Despite these dramatic changes, structural complexity remained high in blowdown areas, as indicated by the size and species distributions of overstory trees, abundance of sound and rotten downed wood, spatial patterns of light availability, and variability of understory vegetation. Furthermore, tree species composition was similar between blowdown and reference areas at each site, with generally shade-tolerant species dominating across multiple canopy strata. Community response to intermediate-severity blowdown at these sites suggests a dynamic in which disturbance maintains late-successional species composition rather than providing a regeneration opportunity for shade-intolerant, pioneer species. Our findings suggest that intermediate-severity wind disturbances can contribute to stand-scale structural complexity as well as development toward late-successional species composition, at least when shade-tolerant regeneration is present pre-blowdown. Advance regeneration thus enhances structural and compositional resilience to this type of disturbance. This study provides a baseline for multi-cohort silvicultural systems designed to restore heterogeneity associated with natural disturbance dynamics.},

  abstract = {In agricultural landscapes, small woodland patches can be important wildlife refuges. Their value in maintaining biodiversity may, however, be compromised by isolation, and so knowledge about the role of habitat structure is vital to understand the drivers of diversity. This study examined how avian diversity and abundance were related to habitat structure in four small woods in an agricultural landscape in eastern England. The aims were to examine the edge effect on bird diversity and abundance, and the contributory role of vegetation structure. Specifically: what is the role of vegetation structure on edge effects, and which edge structures support the greatest bird diversity? Annual breeding bird census data for 28 species were combined with airborne lidar data in linear mixed models fitted separately at (i) the whole wood level, and (ii) for the woodland edges only. Despite relatively small woodland areas (4.9-9.4 ha), bird diversity increased significantly towards the edges, being driven in part by vegetation structure. At the whole woods level, diversity was positively associated with increased vegetation above 0.5 m and especially with increasing vegetation density in the understorey layer, which was more abundant at the woodland edges. Diversity along the edges was largely driven by the density of vegetation below 4 m. The results demonstrate that bird diversity was maximised by a diverse vegetation structure across the wood and especially a dense understorey along the edge. These findings can assist bird conservation by guiding habitat management of remaining woodland patches.},

  abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt's calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt's outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions.},

In the summer of 2010, we examined giant sequoia regeneration in four groves subjected to: 1) moderate- to high-severity wildfire in 1987 (Case Mountain, Redwood Mountain groves), 2) low-severity wildfire in 2008 (Black Mountain grove), 3) retention harvest (removal of all trees except large-diameter giant sequoia) followed by prescribed burning in the mid-1980s (Black Mountain, Bearskin groves), and 4) nearby unburned and unharvested (control) stands in all groves. Density of giant sequoia regeneration was greater in the moderate-and high-severity wildfire stands than control stands, but there was no difference in giant sequoia regeneration between low-severity burned and control stands. Stands thinned by retention harvest and prescribed burning had greater giant sequoia regeneration than control stands. Across all control and low-to moderate- severity wildfire stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with canopy gaps. In wildfire and retention harvest stands, giant sequoia regeneration was positively associated with distance to gap edge, direct and indirect solar radiation, and soil moisture. Our results corroborate previous studies in finding that giant sequoia regeneration benefits from fire. Both wildfire and prescribed fire (preceded by harvest or not) can serve to promote giant sequoia regeneration, providing that fire intensity is sufficient to create canopy gaps, increase understory light, and remove surface litter.},

Using case studies from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), we show how new tools can be applied to map ungulate migrations and assess threats across multiple seasonal habitats, serving as a conservation roadmap. To help conserve ungulate migrations, we also propose a transboundary science, policy, and management framework that could be adapted beyond the GYE and that encompasses the needs of multiple species. The key elements of this framework consist of more widespread mapping and assessment of migrations, improved federal and state coordination across jurisdictional lines, increased investment in private land conservation, and strong engagement of local stakeholders positioned to sustain conservation activities over the long term.},

  abstract = {Multi-temporal change detection is commonly used in the detection of changes to ecosystems. Differencing single band indices derived from multispectral pre- and post-fire images is one of the most frequently used change detection algorithms. In this paper we examine a commonly used index used in mapping fire effects due to wildland fire. Subtracting a post-fire from a pre-fire image derived index produces a measure of absolute change which then can be used to estimate total carbon release, biomass loss, smoke production, etc. Measuring absolute change however, may be inappropriate when assessing ecological impacts. In a pixel with a sparse tree canopy for example, differencing a vegetation index will measure a small change due stand-replacing fire. Similarly, differencing will produce a large change value in a pixel experiencing stand-replacing fire that had a dense pre-fire tree canopy. If all stand-replacing fire is defined as severe fire, then thresholding an absolute change image derived through image differencing to produce a categorical classification of burn severity can result in misclassification of low vegetated pixels. Misclassification of low vegetated pixels also happens when classifying severity in different vegetation types within the same fire perimeter with one set of thresholds. Comparisons of classifications derived from thresholds of dNBR and relative dNBR data for individual fires may result in similar classification accuracies. However, classifications of relative dNBR data can produce higher accuracies on average for the high burn severity category than dNBR classifications derived from a universal set of thresholds applied across multiple fires. This is important when mapping historic fires where precise field based severity data may not be available to aid in classification. Implementation of a relative index will also allow a more direct comparison of severity between fires across space and time which is important for landscape level analysis. In this paper we present a relative version of dNBR based upon field data from 14 fires in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, USA. The methods presented may have application to other types of disturbance events. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Aged dead trees are more likely to contain hollows and therefore automated detection of them plays a substantial role in preserving biodiversity and consequently maintaining a resilient ecosystem. For this purpose full-waveform LiDAR data were acquired from a native Eucalypt forest in Southern Australia. The structure of the forest significantly varies in terms of tree density, age and height. Additionally, Eucalyptus camaldulensis have multiple trunk splits making tree delineation very challenging. For that reason, this paper investigates automated detection of dead standing Eucalyptus camaldulensis without tree delineation. It also presents the new feature of the open source software DASOS, which extracts features for 3D object detection in voxelised FW LiDAR. A random forest classifier, a weighted-distance KNN algorithm and a seed growth algorithm are used to create a 2D probabilistic field and to then predict potential positions of dead trees. It is shown that tree health assessment is possible without tree delineation but since it is a new research directions there are many improvements to be made.},

We addressed three main questions: (a) Oaks and close-to-nature forestry - what are the key silvicultural challenges and options?, (b) What is the particular significance of ecological continuity and which structural features are of importance for biodiversity conservation in oak forests?, (c) What are the key elements and possible strategies of forest management that sustain the ecological values in oak forests in combination with viable forestry? Light availability appeared to be a conspicuous link connecting the conservation and the silvicultural aspects of multifunctional oak forest management: Both young oak trees and multiple oak woodland specialist species are characterized by their need for increased sunlight exposure. This common denominator provides a sound basis for integrative management practices for forestry and nature conservation. The concept of retention forestry offers purposeful approaches. So the harvest of valuable timber oaks or the creation of canopy gaps for oak regeneration can be used to release the crowns and trunks of habitat oaks from shading and competition. When looking at the management of oak woodland biodiversity hotspots, the re-establishment of (modified) historical forest management techniques, which increase stand openness and create transitional habitats that provide suitable oak regeneration niches, seems to be necessary. Not only the continuity of oak woodland cover and natural site conditions, but also the uninterrupted temporal continuity and availability of wood-related structural features turned out to be of particular importance for oak woodland specialist species. We identified an urgent need for systematic forest planning approaches that secure the long-term availability of these structural features within areas or ``sustainability units\{''\} that are large enough to maintain viable populations of oak woodland specialist species. In particular, conservation-oriented forestry measures should mainly be implemented in those areas, where the greatest effectiveness is to be expected. In the sustainability units, oak regeneration measures ought to take place either in close vicinity to old oak stands or directly in these stands. The choice of one of these options should be based on a careful consideration of the needs and possibilities of both silvicultural and nature conservation management.},

  abstract = {Citizens' field observations are increasingly stored in accessible databases, which makes it possible to use them in research. Citizen science (CS) complements the field work that must necessarily be carried out to gain an understanding of any of bird species' ecology. However, CS data holds multiple biases (e.g. presence only data, location error of bird observations, spatial data coverage) that should be paid attention before using the data in scientific research. The use of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) enables investigating forest bird species' habitat preferences in detail and over large areas. In this study the breeding time habitat preferences of 25 forest bird species were investigated by coupling CS observations together with nine forest structure parameters that were computed using ALS data and field plot measurements. Habitat preferences were derived by comparing surroundings of presence-only observations against the full landscape. Also, in order to account for bird observation location errors, we analysed several buffering alternatives. The results correspond well with the known ecology of the selected forest bird species. The size of a bird species' territory as well as some behavioural traits affecting detectability (song volume, mobility etc.) seemed to determine which bird species' CS data could be analysed with this approach. Especially the habitats of specialised species with small or medium sized territories differed from the whole forest landscape in the light of several forest structure parameters. Further research is needed to tackle issues related to the behaviour of the observers (e.g. birdwatchers' preference for roads) and characteristics of the observed species (e.g. preference for edge habitats), which may be the reasons for few unexpected results. Our study shows that coupling CS data with ALS yield meaningful results that can be presented with distribution figures easy to understand and, more importantly, that can cover areas larger than what is normally possible by means of purpose-designed research projects. However, the use of CS data requires an understanding of the process of data collection by volunteers. Some of the biases in the data call for further thinking in terms of how the data is collected and analysed.},

However, the consequences of variable retention harvesting for new cohort growth and survival are not well characterized in many forest ecosystems. Moreover, the relative importance of resource preemption by existing ground layer vegetation after variable retention harvests is unclear. We addressed both in a VRH experiment implemented as a randomized block design replicated four times in red pine forest in Minnesota, USA. Treatments included a thinning with residual trees dispersed evenly throughout the stand (dispersed) and two patch cuts that left 0.1 ha gaps (small gap) or 0.3 ha gaps (large gap) in a forest matrix. Residual basal area was held near constant in the three harvest treatments. We planted seedlings of three common pines (Pinus banksiana, P. strobus and P. resinosa) and measured light, soil nutrients and growth over seven growing seasons. We hypothesized that forests with equivalent average structures (e.g., basal area) would have higher stand-level seedling growth and survival in aggregated retention versus dispersed retention stands. However, variable retention harvest resulted in relatively small differences in growth and survival across the three retention treatments (although all differed as expected from uncut controls). Species specific responses to overstory treatments were partially related to shade tolerance. Tolerant white pine had high survival across all overstory treatments whereas intolerant red and jack pine had lower survival in uncut controls. In general, jack pine had the strongest growth response to reduction of overstory density. However, both white and jack pine achieved highest growth in the dispersed treatment despite differences in shade tolerance. Regardless of species, shrubs had a strong impact on seedling growth. Indeed, differences in growth were often larger across shrub treatments than among retention treatments. Our results support the hypothesis that shrubs preempt resources and dampen the impacts of different overstory retention patterns on new cohort growth and survival. Our results imply that managers have considerable flexibility to employ various types of retention patterns coupled with planting in red pine ecosystems at least at the levels of retention studied here.

The moths were sampled in four different forest stands: three stands (clearcutting, aggregated retention, and no cutting) in a planted Japanese larch forest and one stand in a natural Mongolian oak forest. The results revealed that the moth communities changed in response to the changes in vegetation after the implementation of forest management practices, and clearcutting increased the abundance and species richness of herbivorous and warm-adapted species. The structure and function of moth communities were affected by the forest management practices such as clearcutting and aggregated retention, which were reflected by a decrease in community indices and change in moth community composition with changes in vegetation.},

  abstract = {The identification of landscape metrics that could be used as surrogate of biodiversity is still of broad and current interest in ecology. Several landscape metrics used to provide a quantitative description of environmental structure and related to the landscape heterogeneity were proposed in ecological modelling procedures as surrogates or indicators of biodiversity metrics. Most frequently, the species occupancy in a given area is related to the niche availability, which is correlated with the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape (e.g. number of different land use patches). However, the effectiveness of biodiversity indicators (biotic indicators: e.g. species, group of species; abiotic indicators: e.g. environmental characteristics, landscape metrics) is still discussed and more efficient surrogates are needed. In this study, we explored the associations among the most common landscape metrics and several diversity and community metrics calculated for bird assemblages in the Czech Republic. Using Generalized Linear Models, we compared the strength and direction of these associations as well as their performance in three different environments. Overall, taxonomic diversity was explained by landscape metrics most accurately, even across different types of environments. The most effective landscape metric for bird species richness was the mean patch size, which was negatively correlated. In mixed environments, the functional evenness was positively correlated with the Simpson evenness, the reason probably lying in the fact that both are measures of the regularity of the distribution of relative abundances. Finally, the surrogacy of landscape metrics was weak in forest environments, where even the most effective predictor, the Simpson evenness was only poorly associated to diversity metrics. In this regard, we hypothesize that for modelling more accurately diversity metrics in forest environments, vertical data (e.g. vegetation structure, LiDAR) could be required. Our findings are useful for ecological modelling, enabling the selection of the most appropriate landscape metrics to predict each diversity metric.},

Although simplification of communities across space is often significant at larger scales, it could also occur at the local scale by changing biotic interactions. This study aimed to elucidate local community processes driving biotic homogenization of soil faunal communities, and the possibility of biotic re-differentiation. We recorded species of oribatid mites in litter and soil layers along a gradient of forest conversion from monoculture larch plantation to primary forests in central Japan. We collected data for functional traits of the recorded species to quantify functional diversity. Then we quantified their taxonomic/functional turnover. Litter diversity was reduced in the larch-dominated stands, leading to habitat homogenization. Consequently, litter communities were biologically homogenized and differentiated in the plantations and in the natural forest, respectively. Turnover of functional traits for litter communities was lower and higher than expected by chance in the plantations and in the natural stand, respectively. This result suggests that the dominant assembly process shifts from limiting similarity to habitat filtering along the forest restoration gradient. However, support for such niche-based explanations was not observed for communities in the soil layer. In the monocultures, functional diversity expected from a given regional species pool significantly decreased for litter communities but not for those in the soil layer. Such discrepancy between communities in different layers suggests that communities more exposed to anthropogenic stresses are more vulnerable to the loss of their functional roles. Our study explains possible community processes behind the observed patterns of biological organization, which can be potentially useful in guiding approaches for restoring biodiversity.},

  abstract = {1. Retention forestry, in which trees and tree patches are set aside at harvest to promote biodiversity, has been proven to have positive effects on biodiversity at the stand-level across different taxa. However, the effectiveness of retention approaches with regard to landscape composition remains unexplored. 2. We linked the effect sizes from two meta-analyses (31 case studies and 1050 comparisons from boreal and temperate regions), which quantified the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation as a result of retention practices, with the stand property of retention level (the percentage of trees retained after logging) and with Landsat-retrieved landscape data on forest cover and spatial configurations at three spatial scales (1, 3, and 5 km radii). 3. We found that, in addition to the fundamental importance of tree retention as a local-scale implementation for conservation, landscape properties were important in models to predict biodiversity responses. The effect sizes for species richness decreased with increasing patch contiguity within the landscapes at all spatial scales. Similar results were observed for abundance responses at the largest spatial scale. These results suggest that biodiversity responses to tree retention may be weaker in less fragmented landscapes, which is in agreement with theoretical and empirical findings from agricultural landscapes (the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis'). 4. The benefits of retention levels within a stand (percentage of trees retained) varied amongst species with different habitat requirements (forest-dependent, open habitat, and generalist species). Whilst this stand-level property was often an important determinant of biodiversity responses, models that included landscape properties as explanatory variables always performed better than those that were only based on the retention levels for all species groups. Thus, within-stand habitat conditions and landscape configurations likely have synergetic influences on biodiversity responses. 5. Synthesis and applications. In addition to the importance of stand-level properties, such as the action of retention harvesting itself and the number of trees retained, conditions in the surrounding landscape can simultaneously affect biodiversity in stands that are managed under retention forestry. Our study suggests that retention patches are particularly important in moderately fragmented landscapes. Retention practices could be less important in previously unlogged and less fragmented landscapes, where setting aside large reserves is a conservation priority. For highly fragmented landscapes, different actions of forest restoration, which are not limited to set-aside actions during logging, would be important. Our study emphasizes that carefully planned conservation schemes with a large-scale perspective, as well as local-scale actions, such as retention forestry, are critical for effective forest management and conservation planning.},

  abstract = {Currently, there is an increasing need for sustainable forest management to meet multiple beneficial social and ecological goals. This has spurred the emergence of retention forestry, which aims to maintain key elements of the stand during harvesting to ameliorate the post-logging structure over forest generations. Despite the global expansion of this approach as a conservation tool in production forests, quantitative evaluations of its effectiveness are still lacking, particularly for comparisons across different biomes, different levels of economic development, and different taxa. We conducted a meta-analysis to identify the general responses of forest species to the set-aside actions (i.e., retaining the important biotic and abiotic features during logging to conserve biodiversity). We found that retention forestry can preserve a degree of species richness equivalent to that of primary forests, at least at the stand level. This potential does not differ among regions or economic development levels, supporting the ecological meaning of retaining ``biological legacies\{''\} over forest generations irrespective of forest biomes. Despite their common focus on biodiversity conservation, retention forestry is different from the reduced-impact forestry that is implemented with selective logging. The reason for this difference is that the former and the latter approach focus on what is retained and what is logged during harvesting operations, respectively. Thus, our meta-analysis also focused on comparisons between these two logging methods based on different viewpoints, i.e., from the species perspective vs. the perspective of human needs. We found that although selective logging was not detrimental to forest taxa, retention forestry was more effective in conserving biodiversity. We thus argue that the principles underpinned by retention approach, such as the consideration of natural disturbance regimes, and the provision of important habitats for species, will be essential overall for biodiversity-oriented forestry. Retention forestry will continue to play a fundamental role in encouraging further development of management schemes that have multiple goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, consequences of forest loss for bird assemblages associated with wetlands and their associated riparian areas and shoreline forests are poorly understood. Using the multivariate approach, Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN), we assessed the response of bird communities to an agricultural conversion gradient at two spatial scales: (1) locally within 500 m of a wetland, and (2) throughout a 5 \texttimes{} 5 km landscape. We compared results from a study area in Manitoba surrounded by agriculture (DMMB) to those from a landscape where agriculture is encroaching from the southern edge in east-central Alberta (ECAB). Both species-level and community-level changes tended to occur at lower levels of agricultural conversion in DMMB than in ECAB, particularly at the landscape scale. Community-level changes were more gradual and reached a single maximum at the wetland scale, whereas there were two to three distinct community-level change-points at the landscape scale. Species responding positively (15 in ECAB and 18 in DMMB) to agricultural conversion were typical of open-country ecoregions, while species that responded negatively (13 in each of ECAB and DMMB) tended to be those for which loss of forest cover represented direct loss of habitat. For species common to both regions, direction of response (+ or -) was typically consistent, but specific change-points differed. Where conversion of forest to agriculture is unavoidable in boreal forests, limiting the total amount of forest and wetland vegetation loss around wetlands and within the landscape matrix to {$\leq$} 30\%, along with wetland preservation, will have the greatest benefit to conserving bird communities typical of boreal wetlands and their adjacent riparian areas and forests.},

This study investigated the noises caused by residual sub-pixel clouds on several frequently-used spectral indices (NDVI, EVI, EVI2, NDWI, and NDII) by using in situ spectral data and sky photographs at the satellite overpass time. We conducted in situ continuous observation at a Japanese deciduous forest for over a year and compared the MODIS spectral indices with the cloud-free in situ spectral indices. Our results revealed that residual sub-pixel clouds potentially contaminated about 40\% of the MODIS data after cloud screening by the state flag of MOD09 product. These residual clouds significantly decreased NDVI values during the leaf growing season. However, such noises did not appear in the other indices. This result was thought to be caused by the different combination of wavelengths among spectral indices. Our results suggested that the noises by residual sub-pixel clouds can be reduced by using EVI, NDWI, or NDII in place of NDVI.},

Consequently, forest structures have been modified, and there are no old growth remains. In the last decades, however, many forests have been withdrawn from regular management, because wood production was unprofitable, and left to develop naturally. At the same time, in currently managed forests, silvicultural systems able to develop or maintain old-growth characteristics are being required. The aim of this paper was to assess the status and developmental dynamics of old-growth characteristics in mixed beech, silver fir, and Norway spruce montane forests of the eastern Italian Alps. We selected along a naturalness gradient (a) three old-growth forests in Bosnia and Montenegro (due to the lack of old-growth forests in the Italian Alps), (b) two forests withdrawn from regular management for at least 50 years, and (c) three currently managed forests. In each forest, we analysed 17 structural attributes, in order to assess their value as indicators of old-growth condition. Old-growth forests were characterized by significantly higher amounts of live and dead biomass, share of beech in the dominant and regeneration layers, and number of large trees. The diameter distribution was best described as a rotated sigmoid, differently from currently and formerly managed forest. We discuss the differences in old-growth characteristics across the management gradient and use our results to evaluate the effectiveness of retention prescriptions currently applied in the studied regions in maintaining or promoting old-growth structural attributes in managed forests.},

  abstract = {Management of restored areas requires ecologically meaningful spatial data providing objective measures of restoration success. Understanding relationships between species diversity on the one hand and habitat heterogeneity and productivity on the other can help establish such measures and prioritize restoration management. We used airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data to derive characteristics of vegetation structure, primary productivity and senescent vegetation (i.e. old dead vegetation) for prediction of richness and rarity of bird communities colonizing newly available habitats restored after coal mining. In addition, we analysed, which type of restoration (i.e. agricultural, forest, or spontaneous succession) results in more favourable conditions. The boosted regression trees explained 52\% and 12\% of deviance of overall species richness and rarity, respectively. We found that the overall species richness was strongly affected by the variance in vegetation structure, while the rarity was also affected by the presence of senescent vegetation. The relative importance of variables differed between the richness and rarity. The shrub cover had a strong positive effect on both, while the tree cover had a strong positive effect on species richness. The herbaceous cover and presence of senescent vegetation had positive effects on species rarity. This study, therefore, supports the necessity to create a mosaic of habitats with heterogeneous vertical structure including all layers of vegetation and highlights the importance of senescent vegetation. Combination of forests restoration with sites left to spontaneous succession appears to be the best strategy to increase both bird species richness and rarity in newly restored sites after coal mining.},

  abstract = {Understanding the processes shaping biological communities under multiple disturbances is a core challenge in ecology and conservation science. Traditionally, ecol-ogists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities , have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems. Disturbance and biodiversity: why traits should matter Despite conservation efforts, biodiversity loss continues apace at regional or global scales across a wide range of ecosystems, due to increasing intensity of disturbances (see Glossary), such as overexploitation of species [1], destruction of habitats [2], climate change [3], or invasion by alien species [4]. As a feedback, biodiversity erosion is imperiling the sustainability of ecological processes and the provision of ecosystem services [5]. Thus, there is an urgent need to quantify and predict the effects of disturbance on biodiversity patterns to guide conservation efforts and the management of ecological resources. Here, we consider the term 'disturbance' in its widest sense as any event, natural or human-driven, that causes temporary and localized shifts in species demographic rates. We classify disturbances in three categories as those caused by (i) direct human impacts; (ii) biotic pressure (mainly imposed by exotic species); and (iii) environmental changes (abrupt shifts in abiotic conditions and habitat degradation). Until recently, the effect of disturbance on species diversity was largely assumed to be unimodal, with species diversity reaching its maximum at intermediate levels of disturbance [6]. The underlying mechanistic explanation for this pattern is that competitive exclusion may reduce species richness at low levels of disturbance, whereas high levels of disturbance exclude all but the most disturbance-tolerant species. However, the unimodal model is far from universal, having been falsified by observational [7], experimental [8], and theoretical studies [9]. Moreover, Review Glossary Disturbance: any event, natural or human driven, that causes temporary and localized shifts in demographic rates. Fourth-corner analysis: a method that quantifies the correlations between species traits and abiotic variables in a fourth matrix using three input matrices (R, abiotic variables; L, species presences and/or absences or abundances; and Q, species traits). Functional dissimilarity: the dissimilarity in the functional space occupied by two communities. Functional divergence: the proportion of total abundance supported by species with the most extreme trait values within a community. Functional diversity: the distribution of species and their abundances in the functional space of a given community. Functional evenness: the regularity of the distribution and relative abundance of species in functional space for a given community. Functional identity: the mean value of functional traits, weighted by abundance, across all species present in a given community. Functional originality: the isolation of a species in the functional space occupied by a given community. Functional richness: the volume of multidimensional space occupied by all species in a community within functional space. Functional space: a multidimensional space where the axes are functional traits along which species are placed according to their functional trait values. Functional specialization: the mean distance of a species from the rest of the species pool in functional space. Functional trait: any trait directly influencing organismal performance. Linear trait-environment method (LTE): a method that linearly relates species traits to abiotic variables using species abundances across environments. Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt): a predictive model assuming that the relative abundance of a given species in a given environment is a function of its trait values. Monotonic relation: a relation is monotonic if a response or dependent variable consistently increases (or decreases) or stays the same with every increase in an associated predictive or independent variable. Performance filter: the process by which local abiotic variables determine the performance of a given trait, defined as its fitness, in a given environment. RLQ analysis: a three-table (R, abiotic variables; L, species abundances; Q, species traits) ordination method testing the relations between species traits and abiotic variables. Trait filtering: the process by which abiotic variables determine whether a species has the requisite traits to colonize, establish, and persist in a given environment. Trait: any morphological, physiological, or phenological feature usually measurable at the individual level. Unimodal relation: a relation is unimodal if a response or dependent variable has a single mode (or peak) along the axis of the predictive or independent variable. Corresponding author: Mouillot, D.

However, do post-harvest and post-fire patches maintain the same structural complexity? This study compares post-harvest and post-fire residual patches and proposes retention modalities that can maintain the same structural complexity as in natural forests, here considering both continuous forest stands and post-fire residual patches. In boreal black spruce forests, 41 post-fire residual patches, and 45 post-harvest retention patches of varying size and ages (exposure time to disturbed matrix) and 37 continuous forest stands were classified into six diameter structure types. Types 1 (inverted-J) and 2 (trunked-unimodal) characterized stands dominated by small trees. The abundance of small trees decreased and the abundance of large trees increased from Type 1 to Type 6. Type 6 had the most irregular structure with a wide range of diameters. This study indicates that: (1) old post-harvest residual retentions maintained the range of structural complexity found in natural stands; (2) Types 1 and 2 were generally associated with young post-fire patches and post-harvest retention clumps; (3) the structure of residual patches containing only small trees was usually younger (in terms of the age of the original forest from which residual patches were formed) than those with larger trees. To avoid the risk of simplifying the structure, retention patches should be intentionally oriented towards Types 3-6, dominated by intermediate and large trees.},

  abstract = {In managed boreal forests, variable retention harvest is considered by forest managers as a means of mitigating harvest impacts on biodiversity. Variable retention harvest consists of maintaining within a cut block structural attributes of the original forest stand in intact forest patches that could provide quality habitat (i.e., with large trees and deadwood) for many forest species during forest regeneration. However, retention patch modalities (size, shape, age of the forest) allowing both persistence and sustainable recruitment of deadwood over time remains unknown. The objective of this study is to evaluate the abundance of recent deadwood in post-harvest and post-fire residual patches and to compare their temporal dynamics in black spruce dominated stands located in northwestern Quebec. Abundance of the recent deadwood, estimated as the sum of recent standing deadwood volume and recently fallen deadwood volume was analyzed in 41 post-fire residual patches, and in 45 post-harvest retention patches of varying ages (i.e. exposure time to the disturbed matrix) and in 37 continuous black spruce forest stands (controls). This study shows that post-fire residual patches appear in general more durable than post-harvest retention patches after disturbance. In a management context, our results indicate that: (1) large island patches and large linear separators oriented to escape windthrow usually have deadwood recruitment dynamics similar to that of post-fire patches; (2) retention patches with an initial stand volume greater than 60 m(3)/ha will generate more deadwood volume over time. This suggests that the selection of large retention patches in the shape of an island or a separator, with high volume (between 60 and 300 m3/ha) should help increase the persistence of post-harvest retention patches in black spruce forest, and simultaneously ensure quality habitat for several forest species while the adjacent managed forest regenerates.

  abstract = {Estimating biodiversity in complex habitats, particularly in forests, is still a major challenge for ecologists and conservationists. In ground-breaking work, Robert MacArthur and his colleagues quantified relationships between bird and vertical vegetation diversity, and found that the diversity of vegetation structure strongly influenced bird species diversity. However, they were limited in spatial extent when describing vertical vegetation structure due to the labor-intensive nature of data collection. Current remote sensing techniques, such as LiDAR, can describe ecologically relevant measurements of forest structure across broad extents, and thus, there are increasing efforts to examine relationships between LiDAR-derived data and patterns of animal biodiversity. LiDAR-based data have been utilized for silvicultural assessments for over a decade, but LiDAR use in biodiversity studies is more recent. LiDAR data can assist in the assessment of local animal diversity across taxa, and might assist in larger scale biodiversity assessments in remote and rugged environments. In the following chapter, we first briefly discuss the role of vegetation structure in biodiversity studies, followed by a description of the variables that are most commonly used in biodiversity studies. We then give an overview of biodiversity studies that have utilized LiDAR in forests to date. Although there is a growing body of literature relating LiDAR-derived variables to single species distributions and habitat quality, we focus this chapter solely on studies that address animal species diversity in forested landscapes. We conclude with a discussion of future directions concerning biodiversity assessments in forested systems that might benefit from the use of LiDAR-based data.},

  abstract = {Modelling and forecasting of the distribution and abundance of organisms using environmental variables is a major focus of applied ecological research. High-resolution airborne laser scanning is a recently developed remote-sensing method that provides data that can be used as surrogates for the vertical structure of the vegetation. These data can be used for modelling the occurrence and abundance of species or species assemblages. Until now, few studies evaluated the potential of these data for use in such models, or compared the suitability of data obtained by airborne systems with data gained by alternative methods. To fill part of this gap, we used forest passerine bird species to evaluate airborne laser scanning data for statistical modelling of potential bird abundances and composition of assemblages. Birds were counted in a mixed montane forest, on 223 1-ha plots along four transects. In the same period, these areas were scanned using Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) to characterise canopy structure. Additionally, we used visual interpretations of aerial photographs and field measurements on the same plots to derive habitat variables for comparison. We found clear correlations between the LiDAR variables and the other two variable sets using canonical correlation analysis. With a few exceptions, predictive power of the LiDAR data set for modelling abundances of single species, with up to 40\% explained variance, was superior to that of the other two data sets. Models agreed with existing ecological knowledge for these species. For modelling of species composition with redundancy analysis, LiDAR was also superior to the other two data sets with more than 20\% unique contribution to the explained variance. Our results clearly showed that LiDAR provides valuable data for describing and modelling single species as well as assemblages of forest organisms. \textcopyright{} 2009 Gesellschaft f\"ur \"Okologie.},

  abstract = {1. Effective biodiversity management can only be implemented if data are available on assemblage-environment relationships. The level of detail needs to be relevant to the scale of planning and decision making. A number of remote-sensing methods are available, but there are few studies that link information collected at both landscape and local scales. This is particularly true for arthropods even though these organisms are ecologically very important. 2. We assessed the predictive power of habitat variables measured by airborne laser scanning (light detection and ranging; LiDAR) to model the activity, richness and composition of assemblages of forest-dwelling beetles. We compared the results with data acquired using conventional field methods. We sampled beetles with pitfall traps and flight-interception traps at 171 sampling stations along an elevation gradient in a montane forest. 3. We found a high predictive power of LiDAR-derived variables, which captured most of the predictive power of variables measured in ground surveys. In particular, mean body size and species composition of assemblages showed considerable predictability using LiDAR-derived variables. The differences in the predictability of species richness and diversity of assemblages between trap types can be explained by sample size. We expect predictabilities with R 2 of up to 0{$\cdot$}6 for samples with 250 individuals on average. 4. The statistical response of beetle data and the ecological interpretability of results showed that airborne laser scanning can be used for cost-effective mapping (LiDAR : field survey : beetles 15 : 100 : 260 \texteuro{} ha-1) of biodiversity even in remote mountain areas and in structurally complex habitats, such as forests. 5. Synthesis and applications. The strong relationship between characteristics of beetle assemblages to variables derived by laser scanning provides an opportunity to link data from local ground surveys of hyperdiverse taxa to data collected remotely at the landscape scale. This will enable conservation managers to evaluate habitats, define hotspots or map activity, richness and composition of assemblages at scales relevant for planning and management. In addition to the large area that can be sampled remotely, the grain of the data allows a single tree to be identified, which opens up the possibility of planning management actions at local scales. \textcopyright{} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

  abstract = {Whether diversity and composition of avian communities is determined primarily by responses of species to the floristic composition or to the structural characteristics of habitats has been an ongoing debate, at least since the publication of MacArthur and MacArthur (1961). This debate, however, has been hampered by two problems: 1) it is notoriously time consuming to measure the physiognomy of habitat, particularly in forests, and 2) rigorous statistical methods to predict the composition of bird assemblages from assemblages of plants have not been available. Here we use airborne laser scanning (lidar) to measure the habitat (vegetation) structure of a montane forest across large spatial extents with a very fine grain. Furthermore, we use predictive co-correspondence and canonical correspondence analyses to predict the composition of bird communities from the composition and structure of another community (i.e. plants). By using these new techniques, we show that the physiognomy of the vegetation is a significantly more powerful predictor of the composition of bird assemblages than plant species composition in the field and as well in the shrub/tree layer, both on a level of p{$<$}0.001. Our results demonstrate that ecologists should consider remote sensing as a tool to improve the understanding of the variation of bird assemblages in space and time. Particularly in complex habitats, such as forests, lidar is a valuable and comparatively inexpensive tool to characterize the structure of the canopy even across large and rough terrain.

  abstract = {Topography, as captured by a digital elevation model (DEM), can be used to model soil moisture conditions because water tends to flow and accumulate in response to gradients in gravitational potential energy. A widely used topographic index, the soil wetness index (SWI), was compared with a new algorithm that produces a cartographic depth-to-water (DTW) index based on distance to surface water and slope. Both models reflect the tendency for soil to be saturated. A 1 m resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEM and a 10 m conventional photogrammetric DEM were used and results were compared with field-mapped wet soil areas for a 193 ha watershed in Alberta, Canada, for verification. The DTW model was closer to field-mapped conditions. Values of Kmatch90 (areal correspondence, smaller values indicating better performance) were 7.8\% and 12.3\% for the LiDAR and conventional DEM DTW models, respectively, and 88.5\% and 86.7\% for the SWI models. The two indices were poorly correlated spatially. Both DEMs were found to be useful for modelling soil moisture conditions using the DTW model, but the LiDAR DEM produced the better results. All major wet areas and flow connectivity were reproduced and a threshold value of 1.5 m DTW accounted for 71\% of the observed wet areas. The poor performance of the SWI model is probably because of its over-dependence on flow accumulation. Incorporation of a flow accumulation algorithm that replicates the effects of dispersed flow showed some improvement in the SWI model for the conventional DEM but it still failed to replicate the full areal extent of wet areas. Local downslope topography and hydrologic conditions seemed to be more important in determining soil moisture conditions than is taken account of by the SWI. The DTW model has potential for application in distributed hydrologic modelling, precision forestry and agriculture and implementation of environmental soil management practices.},

We used field measurements during two growing seasons to develop single-species and multispecies regression models predicting the current year's aboveground biomass for eight common cespitose grass species. Simple and stepwise regression analyses were based on natural log expressions of biomass, basal diameter, and height, and a dummy variable expression of grazing history. Basal diameter had the strongest relationship with biomass among single-species (adjusted R-2 0.80 to 0.91) and multispecies (adjusted R-2 = 0.85) models. Regression slopes (b) for diameter among single-species (b = 1.01 to 1.49) and the multispecies (b = 1.25) models suggests that biomass will double when diameter increases similar to 75\%. Height and grazing history added little predictive value when diameter was already in the model. When applied to actual populations, biomass estimates from multispecies models were within 3-29\% of estimates from the single-species models. Although the multispecies biomass-size relationship was robust across the cespitose life-form, users should be cautious about applying our equations to different locations, plant sizes, and population size-structures.},

Prompted by the high demand for temporal and spatial information about the wetland's hydrological regimes and landscape patterns, eight time series Radarsat-2 images were utilized to detect the flooding characteristics of the Zhalong wetland. Subsequently, a random forest model was built to discriminate wetlands from other land cover types, combining with optical, radar, and hydrological regime data derived from multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The results showed that hydrological regimes variables, including flooding extent and flooding frequency, derived from multitemporal SAR images, improve the land cover classification accuracy in the natural wetlands distribution area. The permutation importance scores derived from the random forest classifier indicate that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from optical imagery and the flooding frequency derived from multitemporal SAR imagery were found to be the most important variables for land cover mapping. Accuracy testing indicate that the addition of hydrological regime features effectively depressed the omission error rates (from 52.14\% to 2.88\%) of marsh and the commission error (from 77.34\% to 51.27\%) of meadow, thereby improving the overall classification accuracy (from 76.49\% to 91.73\%).

  abstract = {Recent studies that incorporate the spatial distributions of biological benefits and economic costs in conserva-tion planning have shown that limited budgets can achieve substantially larger biological gains than when planning ignores costs. Despite concern from donors about the effectiveness of conservation interventions, these increases in efficiency from incorporating costs into planning have not yet been widely recognized. Here, we focus on what these costs are, why they are impor-tant to consider, how they can be quantified and the benefits of their inclusion in priority setting. The most recent work in the field has examined the degree to which dynamics and threat affect the outcomes of con-servation planning. We assess how costs fit into this new framework and consider prospects for integrating them into conservation planning. Systematic conservation planning and economic costs In trying to stem biodiversity losses, ecologists and conservation biologists have focused on how conservation plans affect biological targets. The focus of most articles on conservation planning is on the biological benefits of the plans. However, conservation plans cannot be implemen-ted for free. By ignoring the cost side of conservation planning, ecologists and conservation biologists are miss-ing great opportunities to achieve more efficiently conser-vation objectives in a world of limited conservation resources. Systematic conservation planning [1] attempts to solve a cost-effectiveness problem: how to achieve a given con-servation target (e.g. represent at least 10\% of every species range) at least cost; that is, how to achieve the most conservation given limited resources. Although much attention has been devoted to the biological aspects of this problem (e.g. [2\textendash 5]), most conservation planning incorpo-rates economic costs simplistically, using only aggregate measures, such as total area or total number of planning units, as constraints [6,7]. This biology-focused approach implicitly assumes that all areas are equally costly, which is incorrect; just as biodiversity is not distributed evenly},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

In the opening article of this special issue on ,\"A\'u Meta - analytic insights into evolutionary ecology ,\"A\`u, we begin by contrasting meta-analysis with the more traditional ,\"A\`onarrative,\"A\^o reviewing approach. Although it is not without faults, we find that meta-analysis usually outperforms qualitative reviews with respect to testing hypotheses, identifying sources of heterogeneity among primary results, assessing publication bias, and even generating new hypotheses and future research directions. We then highlight the key messages of the nine other contributions to this special issue, on the topics of natural selection, sexual selection, community ecology, host-parasite interactions, plant evolutionary ecology, social behaviour, behavioural syndromes, conservation biology, and methodological advances. We also discuss issues associated with the quality assessments and the inadequate reporting of basic statistics in primary empirical studies, and the need to share credit with the authors of those primary studies through actual citations. Finally, we turn to the future and argue that meta-analysis needs to adopt the principles of systematic reviews, following strict protocols that facilitate replicable and updatable research syntheses. Ecology and evolutionary biology urgently need collaborative networks such as the Cochrane Collaboration in the medical sciences, to oversee the standards of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The formation of a collaborative meta-analytic research network will be an important step for meta-analysis to solidify its central role in research and data synthesis.},

Previous habitat suitability index (HSI) models define the weights of each habitat feature sub-jectively in their approach. To address this problem, we utilized a data-driven Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model to assess the fine-scaled habitat suitability of Red-crowned crane (Gros japonensis) in the breeding period based on the occurrence locations of Red-crowned crane and the habitat features derived from optical, radar imagery and topographical ancillary data. Results of this research show that the developed MaxEnt model improves the performances of previous HSI models. The MaxEnt model could identify the influences of the selected habitat features on the habitat suitability of the species and quantify the optimal habitat conditions for the Red crowned cranes automatically. We found that habitat composition, water depth, and distance to roads and ditches were most important habitat features for Red-crowned cranes in the breeding period. The optimal conditions for each selected habitat features were recognized according to the response curves of environmental variables to occurrence probability of the species. For the breeding Red-crowned cranes, the desirable land cover type of breeding habitat is reed swamp; the suitable depth of water under the canopy is between 15 and 30 cm approximately; the selected vegetation cover is about 47.5\%-74.5\%; and the suitable distance from human disturbances is above 2500 m. This study demonstrated the practicability of the developed species distribution model (MaxEnt) on habitat suitability assessment for Red-crowned cranes, and provided a quantitative and automatic habitat suitability evaluation method for endangered waterfowl's protection.},

Patches of remnant forest retained during harvest are thought to enhance the structural and biological diversity of managed forests, but the extent to which they maintain components of the original understory. or promote recovery in adjacent harvest areas has not been tested. We examined short-term (1- and 2-yr) responses of understory plants to disturbance and creation of edges in structural retention harvest units at two-sites in the western Cascade Range of Washington. Pre- and post-treatment abundance of vascular plants was measured in four (two. at each site) I-ha aggregates (patches of intact forest) and in surrounding harvest areas along sixteen 81 m long transects placed perpendicular to the. edges of these aggregates. Two years after treatment, aggregates had gained an average of two forest species (vs. a loss of two in adjacent areas of harvest) and less than one early-seral species (vs. a gain of nine in adjacent areas of harvest). Aggregates supported populations of late-seral species that disappeared from or declined substantially in harvested areas. However, Aggregates. showed edge-related changes in plant abundance: one third of common understory herbs declined significantly in cover toward the edge, and changes in community composition were distinctly higher within 5 m of the edge than in the aggregate center. Early-seral species established infrequently Within the aggregates, and only within 10 m of the edge. Herbaceous species generally showed larger declines in abundance with proximity to. edge than did shrubs, with declines. becoming more prominent over time. Our results suggest that, over short time frames, forest aggregates of one or more hectares may play an important role in maintaining plant species richness and. composition in forests managed for timber harvest. Assessing the longer term stability of forest aggregates and the degree to which they influence recovery in adjacent areas of harvest will require continued observation.},

One year after treatment, species richness, total cover, and frequency of most moss and liverwort taxa declined within harvest areas. Within forest aggregates, mosses did not show significant edge effects; however, richness and abundance of liverworts declined with proximity to the aggregate edge. Our results suggest that, over short time frames, 1-ha-sized aggregates are sufficient to maintain most common mosses through structural retention harvests but are not large enough to prevent declines or losses of liverworts. Thus, current standards for structural retention, which allow for aggregates as small as 0.2 ha, may be inadequate to retain the diversity and abundance of species found in mature, undisturbed forests.},

  abstract = {Animal movement patterns in space and time are a central aspect of animal ecology. Remotely-sensed environmental indices can play a key role in understanding movement patterns by providing contiguous, relatively fine-scale data that link animal movements to their environment. Still, implementation of newly available remotely-sensed data is often delayed in studies of animal movement, calling for a better flow of information to researchers less familiar with remotely-sensed data applications. Here, we reviewed the application of remotely-sensed environmental indices to infer movement patterns of animals in terrestrial systems in studies published between 2002 and 2013. Next, we introduced newly available remotely-sensed products, and discussed their opportunities for animal movement studies. Studies of coarse-scale movement mostly relied on satellite data representing plant phenology or climate and weather. Studies of small-scale movement frequently used land cover data based on Landsat imagery or aerial photographs. Greater documentation of the type and resolution of remotely-sensed products in ecological movement studies would enhance their usefulness. Recent advancements in remote sensing technology improve assessments of temporal dynamics of landscapes and the three-dimensional structures of habitats, enabling near real-time environmental assessment. Online movement databases that now integrate remotely-sensed data facilitate access to remotely-sensed products for movement ecologists. We recommend that animal movement studies incorporate remotely-sensed products that provide time series of environmental response variables. This would facilitate wildlife management and conservation efforts, as well as the predictive ability of movement analyses. Closer collaboration between ecologists and remote sensing experts could considerably alleviate the implementation gap. Ecologists should not expect that indices derived from remotely-sensed data will be directly analogous to field-collected data and need to critically consider which remotely-sensed product is best suited for a given analysis.},

To that end, monitoring programmes have reported on the state of biodiversity using reference conditions as comparison. Little consensus exists on how reference conditions are defined and how such information is used to index intactness. Most use protected areas or an arbitrary year as reference. This is problematic since protected areas are often spatially biased, while arbitrarily defined reference years are often not sufficiently distant in time. We propose an alternative that relies on empirical estimates of reference conditions. Statistical ranges of reference are estimated and compared with observed occurrence and abundance to index status of individual species. When averaged among species, overall intactness is estimated. We demonstrate the approach using 202-winter mammal tracking sites from the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. Intactness was estimated at 89 out of 100 with the southern boreal having lowest intactness and greatest human footprint. We suggest empirical predictions of reference conditions be used as baselines for comparing changes in the state of species and biodiversity. Reporting can occur at any spatial (e.g., ecosystem) or hierarchical (e.g., species, guilds, taxonomic group, or overall biodiversity) scale and is easily interpreted (scaled from 0-degraded to 100-intact). When used in a long-term monitoring framework, statistical trends in biodiversity intactness can be estimated, individual status of species assessed, and relevant policy evaluated. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Wetland buffers can be constructed simply by routing runoff from forested areas to natural peatlands and wetlands, or by rewetting lower sections of drained peatlands by filling in or blocking the drainage ditches. The use of natural and restored wetland buffers for reducing nutrient and sediment export from forested catchments, particularly catchments dominated by forestry-drained peatlands, has been studied actively in Finland during the last 15 years. The studies have shown highly variable retention capacity for wetland buffers with different site characteristics and under different environmental conditions. In favorable conditions, high amounts of sediments and adhered mineral elements may be deposited within peat and surface vegetation of the buffer. Dissolved nutrients can be retained biologically into plant and microbial biomasses and chemically into peat. In contrast, nitrogen can also be lost into the atmosphere in gaseous form. In this literature review, we summarize the results of the experiments established on natural and restored wetland buffers in forested catchments in Finland to clarify the different processes and factors controlling their nutrient and sediment retention capacity. We also discuss the limitations and possible negative consequences of using wetland buffers for managing water quality in forested catchments.},

Resulting model accuracies varied widely among species. Overall, 8 of 14 species models were improved by including the LiDAR-derived variables. For climate-only models, mean annual precipitation and frost-free periods were the most important variables. With inclusion of LiDAR-derived attributes, depth-to-water table, terrain-intercepted annual radiation, and elevation were most often selected. This suggests that fine-scale terrain conditions affect the distribution of the studied species more than canopy conditions.},

However, monitoring changes in boreal forest structure following disturbance is difficult due to restricted access and the spatial scale at which these disturbances occur. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) measures the three-dimensional distribution of vegetation across large areas with high sampling intensities, enabling the detection of small changes in vegetation structure in stands of otherwise similar composition and age. In this paper we compare the suitability of three suites of ALS metrics to discriminate changes in vegetation structure across a gradient of forest harvest retention levels (100\% retention (uncut control), 75\%, 50\%, 20\%, 10\%, and 0\% (clear cut)) for four boreal forest stand types: conifer, deciduous, mixed, and deciduous with conifer understorey. Specifically, we focus on three key types of ALS metric: plot-based point cloud metrics, canopy volumes, and curve-fitting approaches; and evaluate the sensitivity of these metrics to changes in forest stand architecture in response to the harvest treatments or lack thereof. From the three types of metrics, height based point cloud metrics show the most significant separation by treatments and stand-types, followed by canopy volume profiles. Airborne laser scanning has strong utility for distinguishing responses in silvicultural treatments and cover types, revealing characteristics not captured by traditional measurements like crown closure or basal area.

  abstract = {1. Applied ecological research is increasingly inspired by the open science movement. However, new challenges about how we define our science when biodiversity data are being shared and re-used are not solved. Among these challenges is the risk associated with blurring the distinction between research that mainly seeks to explore patterns with no a-priori articulated hypotheses (exploratory research), and research that explicitly tests a-priori formulated hypotheses (confirmatory research). 2. A rapid screening of a random selection of the peer-reviewed literature suggests that neither experimental protocols nor hypothesis-testing sensu stricto are common in applied ecological research. In addition, most experiments are carried out on small spatial scales, which contrast with current global policy needs and research trends towards addressing large spatial and temporal scales. This latter trend makes it unfeasible for policy to rely mainly on insights gained from experimental research. 3. To solve fundamental local, regional and global societal challenges, we need both exploratory and confirmatory research. However, the fundamental roles that con-firmatory research testing a-priori hypothesis play in establishing causal relationships need to be revaluated in applied ecological research. 4. A clearer distinction between exploratory and confirmatory research is currently needed, and could be facilitated by allocating journal sections to different types of research; by embracing new tools offered by the open science era, such as pre-registration of hypothesis; by establishing new systems where post-hoc hypotheses emerging through exploration can also be registered for later testing; and by more broad adoption of causal inference methods that foster more structured testing of hypotheses about causal mechanisms from observational biodiversity data. 5. Synthesis and applications. To gain the full benefits of the open science era, researchers , funding bodies and journal editors should explicitly consider approaches and incentives that encourage openness about methods and approaches, as well as value the plurality of scientific approaches needed to address questions in applied ecology and conservation science.

To provide better quantification of canopy structure, we used airborne LiDAR imagery to identify canopy cover in different height strata and the size and frequency of gaps that were associated with owl nest sites, protected activity centers (PACs), and territories within four study areas and 316 owl territories. Although total canopy cover was high in nest stands and PAC areas, the cover in tall ( {$>$} 48 m) trees was the canopy structure most highly selected for, while cover in lower strata (2-16 m) was avoided compared to availability in the surrounding landscape. Tall tree cover gradually decreased and lower strata cover increased as distance increased from the nest. Large ( {$>$} 1000 m(2)) gaps were not found near nests, but otherwise there was no difference in gap frequencies and sizes between PACs and territories and the surrounding landscape. Using cluster analysis we classified canopy conditions into 5 structural classes and 4 levels of canopy cover to assess the relationship between total canopy cover and tree size within nest sites, PACs, and territories. High canopy cover ({$>$}= 70\%) mostly occurs when large tree cover is high, indicating the two variables are often confounded. Our results suggest that the cover of tall trees may be a better predictor of owl habitat than total canopy cover because the latter can include cover in the 2-16 m strata - conditions that owls actually avoid. Management strategies designed to preserve and facilitate the growth of tall trees while reducing the cover and density of understory trees may improve forest resilience to drought and wildfire while also maintaining or promoting the characteristics of owl habitat.},

We examined the response of understory plant diversity and basal area increment of retained overstory trees after sixteen months and six years, respectively. in GTR cuts. Understory species cover was sampled on three adjacent treatment areas in the Seattle City Watershed, Washington: a clearcut, a dispersed green tree retention and the intact sixty-five year old forest.

Andrews Experimental Forests in Washington and Oregon. respectively. Herb and shrub species richness and evenness were significantly higher in the green tree retention cut than in the other two understory treatments. Although overall species composition of the GTR was closer to the clearcut than the forest, the GTR retained more species and cover of shade-tolerant plants important for maintaining understory diversity as canopy closure reduces understory light. While the basal area increment response of retained trees varied between stands. the average response for all stands for a six year period following harvest was a 15\% reduction in increment growth compared to the control stands. Additional study is needed to determine the persistence of these effects and how basal area growth response varies as a function of tree size and age.},

Ground-dwelling birds had similar abundance before and after harvesting, but the abundance of individuals of tree- and shrub-inhabiting birds decreased with the amount of remaining vegetation cover. Fourteen of 36 species declined significantly in abundance following logging. Seven of eight species that were absent from clearcuts were retained at very low abundances in partial cuts.

Abstract: Previous measurements of the horizontal components of cover in habitat analyses that employed the "density board" are unsatisfactory for quantitative foliage structure mea-surements. The method employing the "vegetation profile board" technique has been used successfully in measuring variation in the vegetative aspects of bird and rodent habitats. A version of the vegetation profile board was used to quantify various white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) microhabitats. Data collected permitted statistical comparisons of vegetation structure among habitats in one season and among these same habitats at dif-ferent seasons. Several techniques are available for the analysis of ruminant food habits (Korschgen 1971) and for measuring for-age production, availability, and utiliza-tion (DeVos and Mosby 1971), but the influence of the mechanical, optical, and thermal density properties (Moen 1973) of vegetative cover on the suitability of an area for wildlife have been less in-tensively studied. These complex habitat characteristics are often described quali-tatively under the general heading "cover"; there are no consistent methods described in the wildlife literature for the measurement of the components of "cover." This paper reviews a technique used by community ecologists to depict variation in foliage structure of bird and small mammal habitats and its adaptabil-ity to the quantification of the vegeta-tive structure of large mammal},

We assessed responses of songbird assemblages to PRH over a 15-year post-harvest period at the EMEND experiment in the mixedwood forest of Alberta, Canada. Four partial retention levels (10\%, 20\%, 50\%, and 75\% of stems) were applied in a series of 10 ha ``compartments\{''\} during winter 1998-1999 with matching clearcuts and unharvested control compartments in each of three replicates in four common mixedwood cover-types. Songbirds were surveyed using the point count method in 1998 (pre-harvest) and after harvest in 1999, 2000, 2005, 2006, 2012, and 2013. Partial retention harvests that left {$>$}= 20\% of merchantable stems mitigated changes to songbird assemblages away from, and accelerated recovery toward, the unharvested benchmark. However, assemblages of 14- to 15-year-old controls differed from those observed prior to harvest, notably in composition of old-forest associated species, suggesting effects of experiment-scale processes and (or) regional trends not attributable to forestry activities. Although retention levels {$>$}= 20\% appear to better conserve old-forest birds than clear-cutting in the short term, long-term trade-offs with increasing harvest footprint to compensate for unharvested merchantable volume should be investigated.},

The stand was traditionally a uniform operational unit designed to make management efficient. Stand-level objectives on some ownerships have recently shifted toward increasing within-stand variability through the use of various treatments including multiaged systems, variable retention regeneration methods, or variable-density thinning. The result may be greater heterogeneity within rather than between stands, thus leading to this discussion of the relevance of the stand concept in contemporary forestry. We recognize stands as being the logical operational unit for forestry, but with the flexibility to change in boundary over time due to stand dynamics, through management intent, or to include a variety of different stand structures. As a result, stands may be managed to enhance within-stand variability. A new terminology is not needed nor do stands need to be endlessly split into smaller and smaller units as management creates more and more stand variability. The stand remains the logical operational unit of ecosystem-based forestry on a variety of land ownerships, within the context of multiple scale management.},

We leveraged relatively new weather surveillance radar technology to remotely detect departures of discrete groups of various species of migratory dabbling ducks (Anatidae) in autumn to more directly assess the effect of specific weather conditions on departure from discrete stopover sites.MethodsUsing radar data collected over fifteen years (1995-2009), we documented a consistent phenomenon where a single, identifiable group departed from our study area on 30\% of days during the autumn study period, and no ducks departed on the other days. We gathered weather variables from nearby stations and used them to develop competing models to explain temporal patterns of departure versus non-departure to better understand the potential mechanisms associated with binomial patterns of departures.ResultsThe best approximating model of departure probability was our integrated model, which included variables accounting for wind aloft direction favorable for departure (i.e., tailwind), absence of precipitation, and a partially or completely clear sky. The integrated model accounted for all model weight in the candidate set and explained 55\% of the variation in departure probability. Estimated probability of departure was 0.76 after parameterizing the best model with favorable conditions for all covariates.ConclusionsOur results contrasted those of previous studies of autumn duck migration as a small set of simplistic, extrinsic conditions substantially influenced departure decision.},

  abstract = {Increasing the diversity of species and structure of red pine (Pious resinosa) is often a management goal in stands simplified by practices such as fire suppression and plantation management in many areas of the Great Lakes Region. One approach to diversification is to convert predominantly even-aged, pure red pine stands to multi-cohort, mixed-species forests through variable overstory retention at harvest. Based on limited empirical evidence, pathologists have advised against this multi-cohort approach in stands where pathogens causing damaging shoot blight diseases are established. We examined disease incidence among planted red, jack (Pious banksiana), and white pine (Pious strobus) in a variable retention harvest and understory woody vegetation removal (brushing) experiment in northern Minnesota. The experiment included four overstory treatments (dispersed and two aggregated overstory retention treatments and a control, N = 4) that were split by an understory brushing treatment (yes or no). Prior to harvest in 2003, the fungal pine pathogens Diplodia pinea, Sirococcus conigenus and Armillaria solidipes (syn. Armillaria ostoyae) were common on the study site. Within 6 years after harvest, these pathogens reduced the survival of planted red, white and jack pine, potentially interfering with long-term management objectives. Across all treatments, shoot blight incidence was generally higher in dead red and jack pine than white pine seedlings and was predominantly caused by D. pinea. The disease killing white pine seedlings was predominately Armillaria root rot. Overstory treatment affected the percentage of jack and white pine seedling mortality attributable to shoot blight, but not the more susceptible red pine, with greater overstory retention resulting in greater disease incidence. Understory brushing had no effect on the incidence of shoot blight on seedlings. We expect disease to continue to influence stand structure and composition across all treatments. Our study results highlight the need for forest managers to assess long-term risk of potentially damaging pathogens in red pine stands prior to harvest and use that information to guide decisions regarding silvicultural practices to increase age and species diversity.

We tested the hypothesis that retention of mature trees enhances colonization and diversity of EM fungi on seedlings planted in adjacent areas. In total 41 EM morphotypes were described, with mean diversity of 3.47 morphotypes and root colonization of 62\% per seedling. Overall, root colonization declined with distance (72\% at 5 m vs. 52\% at 45 m), as did EM diversity (4.7 at 5 m vs. 2.9 at 45 m). For individual sites, the distance effect was significant for root colonization at four sites and for EM diversity at three to four sites. This suggests that variable retention is important for the recovery of ectomycorrhizal biota in harvested sites. Seedling root colonization was significantly lower in SG sites than in OG sites. Though EM diversity did not differ with stand age, OG sites had potentially more total (34) and unique (14) EM morphotypes than did SG sites (total 27, unique 7). Differences with stand age might be related to the relative abilities of EM fungi to disperse to regenerating second-growth forests.},

We compare the classification performance of ASI (with training templates extracted automatically from field data) to that of monitoR (with training templates extracted manually from the Xeno-Canto database), the results showing ASI to have substantially higher recall and precision rates.},

Bird species (BS) richness and micro-habitat (MH) diversity are two key features that are easily measured and can be utilized as biodiversity surrogates. Remote sensing technologies may be employed as a cost-efficient measure as well as accurately mapping diversity features across broad geographical areas. This study examined the possibilities of predicting BS richness and MH diversity using variables derived from satellite data in a brutian pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) forest ecosystem located in the Southwestern Mediterranean Region of Turkey. The study utilized 40 (90 x 90 m, 0.81 ha) sample plots. We used first, and second-order image texture measures calculated from RapidEye, SPOT-5 and Aster Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as explanatory variables for predicting these biodiversity surrogates at alpha (alpha) level. Stepwise linear regression analyses showed that BS richness and MH diversity can be estimated using image texture measures. According to the cross-validation test; BS richness was best predicted using standard deviation of Gray levels (STD) and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) Homogeneity of RapidEye NDVI (R-CV(2) = 0.73, STEcT = 4.321), while MH diversity was best predicted using STD and GLCM Correlation of SPOT NDVI (R-CV(2) = 0.73, STECV = 0.148). In conclusion, the satellite-based diversity maps produced in this study can provide valuable data for forest managers and assist in formulating adaptive management plans for the ecologically sustainable management of brutian pine forest ecosystems.},

Alternative silvicultural systems such as variable retention harvest, partial and patch cuts, and older forest management practices such as under-planting, are used in many forests around the world, particularly in North American oak stands, the boreal and coastal temperate rain forests of Canada and,the United States, and in many degraded tropical regions of Asia and the Americas. Specific objectives are pursued in each of these biomes, but some are common to most regions, such as preservation of cover and structure and their associated benefits for natural or artificial regeneration, due to moderation of the microclimate, development of optimal light and competition conditions, and reduced predation by herbivores. Shelterwoods are often presented as an alternative to clear-cutting to improve the survival of planted trees. A meta-analysis of published results with randomization tests was performed to test the relationship between overstory density and planted seedling growth and survival. Multiple comparisons were also used to reveal optimal levels of overstory density, if they exist. A majority of studies show that survival and growth improve as stand density decreases to an, intermediate level, below which they either drop or stabilize. This level seems optimal in most conditions, as it is also more apt to fulfill other objectives imposed on today's forest activities, such as the conservation of forest processes and structures, and the reconstruction of degraded stands through the accelerated return of mid- to late-successional species.},

To help identify potential management approaches to address this periodic economic situation, the relationship of stand structure with canopy transmittance was examined in recently harvested boreal mixedwood stands with differing hardwood tree retention levels. Canopy transmittance and residual stand structural features were measured in 483, 0.612 ha circular plots established in recently harvested stands in 12 locations across northern Ontario. For both trembling aspen- and white birch-dominated residual stands, canopy transmittance exhibited a negative exponential relationship with basal area, density, and stand density index. Nonlinear mixed effects models sometimes differed significantly between these two residual stand classes, likely due to species differences in crown architecture and stem size. Application of these models to guide silvicultural activities and improve regeneration planning and biodiversity conservation to better meet local management objectives is discussed.},

  abstract = {Edges are ecologically important environmental features that have been well researched in agricultural and urban landscapes. However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence animal activity patterns, particularly for animals reliant on vegetation for cover, foraging or nesting. We quantified the response of ground-dwelling mammals to fire edges and sought to determine whether animal activity mirrored temporal changes in regenerating understorey vegetation. We used a space-for-time substitution sampling design and selected a series of 26 treatment sites burnt by prescribed fire, where time since fire ranged from 0 to 7 years. Ten long-unburnt sites acted as controls. At each treatment site we identified a burnt/unburnt edge and used camera traps and Elliott traps to survey ground-dwelling mammals on either side. Habitat structure was measured at all 36 sites. We used general and generalised linear mixed models to determine the response of both habitat and animals to time since fire on both burnt and unburnt sides of edges. In addition, we used a resource selection index to assess the congruence between changes in understorey complexity and animal activity identified in the first set of analyses. On the unburnt side of the edge understorey complexity remained constant over time. On the burnt side understorey complexity followed a hump-shaped trend, peaking at 3 years post-fire where it exceeded the level of complexity on the unburnt edge. Larger animals with general resource requirements were more active at burnt compared to unburnt edges immediately after fire, but similarly active on both sides of fire edges from three years post-fire. Despite some activity on the burnt side of edges immediately after fire, small mammals were generally less active on burnt edges compared to unburnt edges for up to three years. Native species' activity did not follow patterns of temporal change in structurally complex understorey vegetation. For all species, selection was strongest at recently burnt edges with little vegetation and substantially lower at 3-7 year old regenerating edges where understorey complexity was higher. In general, patterns of selection on the unburnt side of edges were similar over time. Our findings suggest that vegetation change on the burnt side of fire edges may not be a good predictor of native mammal use. Foxes and cats, exotic predators in our system, were also using the burnt edge more than expected immediately after fire. Immediate post-fire predation may be higher at fire edges than elsewhere, and recently burnt edge zones could be suitable locations for integrated predator and fire management.},

To assess harvest effects, we simulated short (50-year) and long (100-year) harvest intervals, high (clear-cut) and low (selective) harvest intensities, and three levels of residue retention (15\%, 25\%, and 35\%) over a 500-year period. The model simulation of NPP, soil C accumulation, and NEP agreed reasonably well with biometric and eddy-covariance measurements of these two ecosystems. The more intensive (50-year rotation clear-cuts with low residue retention) harvest scenarios tended to have the greatest NEP (420 and 678 t C ha-1 for the 500-year interval for jack pine and sugar maple, respectively). All the harvest scenarios decreased mineral soil C and available mineral soil N content relative to the no-harvest scenario for jack pine and sugar maple. The rate of change in mineral soil C decreased the greatest in the most intensive biomass removal scenarios (-0.012 and -0.072 t C ha-1 yr-1 relative to no-harvest for jack pine and sugar maple, respectively) and the smallest decrease was observed in the least intensive biomass removal scenarios (-0.002 and -0.009 t C ha-1 yr-1 relative to no-harvest for jack pine and sugar maple, respectively).

Growth of all species was greater in all cut treatments than in the control, but the only difference among cut treatments was greater jack pine height growth in large-gap harvests than in small-gap harvests. Proportional diffuse radiation and soil moisture varied considerably by location within the gaps and were highest in gap centers. Seedling growth responses increased from the forest edge into gap centers where overstory influence was least. All three cut treatments could be expected to result in the development of a two-aged stand structure in mature red pine stands such as these. When an aggregate retention harvest is implemented, higher initial mortality and growth could be anticipated for seedlings near the center of the gap.},

Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor, a model species of wild songbird, are well-studied during their breeding season; but our understanding of their biology at other times of the year, when they are not tied to the fixed location of a nest, is more limited. We developed a lightweight radio tag with no battery (solar nanotag) to study the movements of small animals, and we deployed it to explore the behavior of Tree Swallows after the end of their summer breeding season. We tagged 32 breeding adult swallows and 36 juveniles and monitored their presence and absence at the breeding site during the post-fledging period. Although our observations are based on very small sample sizes, the tags revealed previously unknown patterns in Tree Swallow behavior during the post-breeding season. Some Tree Swallow fledglings continued to visit the site repeatedly in the months following the nesting season, with the latest detection occurring on September 30th; by contrast, all adults had permanently departed by the end of July. These results inform future hypotheses about post-breeding movements in Tree Swallows. But, more generally, the detection of tagged swallows on their distant wintering grounds, seven months after tagging, indicates the potential of studying small passerine movements throughout their entire lifetimes, and suggests a rich array of applications for these ``Life Tags\{''\} to study the movements of small animals world-wide.},

In managed temperate oak forests, rotation extension induced by increasing the diameter threshold of final harvest by about 10 cm compared to conventional practices (i.e. DBH around 70 cm) might mitigate this negative effect. Here, we used a gradient of the proportion of overmature trees (DBH ae{$<$}yen{$>$} 80 cm) among mature trees (DBH ae{$<$}yen{$>$} 70 cm) across plots of high oak French forests to test the potential effect of increasing diameter threshold on (1) structural features and (2) species composition and diversity of saproxylic beetles communities. We assessed deadwood and microhabitats availability (i.e. volume/density and diversity) and canopy openness in 81 1-ha plots across eleven French forests. Results highlighted that a larger proportion of overmature trees, for a given density of mature trees, had limited effects on structural features: only cavities density showed a significant positive response, with no cascading effect on cavicolous beetles. Moreover, the proportion of overmature trees had no significant effect on the composition of saproxylic beetles communities (and ecological variables altogether explained only 17\% of the composition inertia). By contrast, mature tree density enhanced microhabitat density and indirectly increased the abundance of rare species. Thus, shifting DBH from 70 to 80 cm in high oak forest could have no or limited effect on saproxylic beetles conservation. Improved strategies might rather stem from combining (1) longer rotation extension and (2) less intensive management practices in extended rotation stands.},

  abstract = {Conservation planning studies at small scales such as forest stands and below are uncommon. However, for retention forestry, developed during the last two decades and with current wide and increasing application in boreal and temperate regions, the need for cost-effective selection of individual trees is evident. In retention forestry certain trees are left at final harvest to promote flora and fauna. There is also a scarcity of studies on information costs and how these relate to the cost-effectiveness of conservation. We addressed both of these issues by studying whether decisions about the retention of aspen Populus tremula L. trees can be made more cost-effectively by including information about tree characteristics. We analyzed data from 12 recently harvested stands in middle Sweden containing 131 epiphytic lichen species (a biodiversity proxy) on 360 aspen trees. We related the presence of lichen species to bark and stem attributes and used those relationships to prioritize trees for retention. We estimated the value of using different sets of survey information (lichens, tree characteristics) to select retention trees to achieve various conservation goals. Depending on species or species groups of interest, and the type of tree information being collected, the value of collecting the information is up to 20\% of the total value of all potential retention trees, which, given current labor costs, allows up to four hours for planning and selecting the right trees on an average-sized clearcut. The current practice of almost randomly selecting aspen trees to retain at final harvest can be improved by adding easily collected information on tree characteristics, such as black-colored bark, slow tree growth, inclining stems and speckled bark. This can lead to attainment of a given level of a conservation goal (like maximizing the number of lichen species of conservation concern) with fewer retention trees. Inventory of tree information often can be performed quickly, and if part of the gains from using such information to guide tree selection would be spent on additional conservation efforts, this would benefit biodiversity. Studies on more organism groups and tree species are needed to increase the applicability of results. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The retention approach has emerged from the recognition that even intense natural disturbances leave biological legacies and spatial heterogeneity in the new forest which contrasts with the simple and homogeneous environment that is often the outcome of traditional harvesting practices. The review presents some insight into the understanding of a complex, self-organising dynamical system that supports organismal units being its branches and leaves in a tree, or a wide variety of flora and fauna in a forest. It seems that the formation of a scale-invariant structure of life cycle events may fit in the general terms of homeostasis, lifespan and fitness, so it could be argued that habitat quality and integrity of forest communities should be evaluated based on the assessment of organism-specific effects and responses in ecosystem functioning. Moreover, biological legacies defined as biologically created patterns that persist from the pre-disturbance ecosystem and influence recovery processes in the post-disturbance ecosystem should include organically derived measures of ecosystem integrity, such as habitat quality.},

  abstract = {1. Essential Biodiversity Variable, Natural Capital, Biodiversity Indicator and Ecosystem Service are four concepts that underpin the most popular frameworks currently considered for helping to coordinate and structure biodiversity monitoring efforts worldwide. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) has considerable potential to inform these initiatives. To date, however, discussions on the role of SRS in supporting these frameworks have mostly evolved independently; tend to be led by different groups; sometimes target slightly different scales; and are likely to reach different audiences. Because of this, there is some confusion among environmental managers and policymakers as to what the potential of SRS is or whether there is prospect in considering and promoting the use of satellite data for biodiversity conservation. 2. Here, we provide a brief overview of the role of SRS to date in informing these frameworks. Through a case study focused on the Sahara Desert ecosystem, we also demonstrate the current potential for SRS-based methodologies to support conservation in data-deficient areas and discuss the relative applicability of SRS-based metrics to each of these frameworks. 3. The relevance and use of SRS across the four frameworks are clearly variable, due to differences and ambiguity in definitions, and due to differences in monitoring priorities. Our case study illustrates the particularly high potential for SRS approaches to provide key information relevant to the Biodiversity Indicators framework in desert ecosystems; it also identifies SRS-based metrics relevant to all frameworks. 4. Altogether, this work highlights how more dialogue is required within the biodiversity-monitoring community for SRS to reach its full potential in conservation. In particular, agreement on what is needed in priority, given the realm of what is possible, will be of paramount importance to developing SRS-based products that are used by policymakers and international conventions.},

The NWFP is a science-based plan incorporating monitoring and adaptive management and provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy. We used {$>$}25 years of region-wide bird surveys, forest data, and land-ownership maps to test this policy's effect on biodiversity. Clearcutting decreased rapidly, and we expected populations of older-forest-associated birds to stabilize on federal land, but to continue declining on private industrial lands where clearcutting continued. In contrast, we expected declines in early-seral-associated species on federal land because of reduced anthropogenic disturbance since the NWFP. Bayesian hierarchical models revealed that bird species' population trends tracked changes in forest composition. However, against our expectations, declines of birds associated with older forests accelerated. These declines are partly explained by losses of older forests due to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. Indeed, the NWFP anticipated that reversing declines of older forests would take time. Overall, the early-seral ecosystem area was stable, but declined in two ecoregions-the Coast Range and Cascades-along with early-seral bird populations. Although the NWFP halted clearcutting on federal land, this has so far been insufficient to reverse declines in older-forest-associated bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure.},

For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species' range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

  abstract = {Fine root litter is the principal source of carbon stored in forest soils and a dominant source of carbon for fungal decomposers. Differences in decomposer capacity between fungal species may be important determinants of fine-root decomposition rates. Variable-retention harvesting (VRH) provides refuge for ectomycorrhizal fungi, but its influence on fine-root decomposers is unknown, as are the effects of functional shifts in these fungal communities on carbon cycling. We compared fungal communities decomposing fine roots (in litter bags) under VRH, clearcut, and uncut stands at two sites (6 and 13 years postharvest) and two decay stages (43 days and 1 year after burial) in Douglas fir forests in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Fungal species and guilds were identified from decomposed fine roots using high-throughput sequencing. Variable retention had short-term effects on beta-diversity; harvest treatment modified the fungal community composition at the 6-year-postharvest site, but not at the 13-year-postharvest site. Ericoid and ectomycorrhizal guilds were not more abundant under VRH, but stand age significantly structured species composition. Guild composition varied by decay stage, with ruderal species later replaced by saprotrophs and ectomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizal abundance on decomposing fine roots may partially explain why fine roots typically decompose more slowly than surface litter. Our results indicate that stand age structures fine-root decomposers but that decay stage is more important in structuring the fungal community than shifts caused by harvesting. The rapid postharvest recovery of fungal communities decomposing fine roots suggests resiliency within this community, at least in these young regenerating stands in coastal British Columbia. IMPORTANCE Globally, fine roots are a dominant source of carbon in forest soils, yet the fungi that decompose this material and that drive the sequestration or respiration of this carbon remain largely uncharacterized. Fungi vary in their capacity to decompose plant litter, suggesting that fungal community composition is an important determinant of decomposition rates. Variable-retention harvesting is a forestry practice that modifies fungal communities by providing refuge for ectomycorrhizal fungi. We evaluated the effects of variable retention and clear-cut harvesting on fungal communities decomposing fine roots at two sites (6 and 13 years postharvest), at two decay stages (43 days and 1 year), and in uncut stands in temperate rainforests. Harvesting impacts on fungal community composition were detected only after 6 years after harvest. We suggest that fungal community composition may be an important factor that reduces fine-root decomposition rates relative to those of above-ground plant litter, which has important consequences for forest carbon cycling.},

  abstract = {A critical component of landscape dynamics is the recovery of vegetation following disturbance. The objective of this research was to characterize the forest recovery trends associated with a range of spectral indicators and report their observed performance and identified limitations. Forest disturbances were mapped for a random sample of three major bioclimate zones of North American boreal forests. The mean number of years for forest to recover, defined as time required to for a pixel to attain 80\% of the mean spectral value of the 2 years prior to disturbance, was estimated for each disturbed pixel. The majority of disturbed pixels recovered within the first 5 years regardless of the index ranging from approximately 78\% with normalized burn ratio (NBR) to 95\% with tasselled cap greenness (TCG) and after 10~years more than 93\% of disturbed pixels had recovered. Recovery rates suggest that normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) and TCG saturate earlier than indices that emphasize longer wavelengths. Thus, indices such as NBR and the mid-infrared spectral band offer increased capacity to characterize different levels of forest recovery. The mean length of time for spectral indices to recover to 80\% of the pre-disturbance value for pixels disturbed 10 or more years ago was highest for NBR, 5.6~years, and lowest for TCG, 1.7~years. The mid-infrared spectral band had the greatest difference in recovered pixels among bioclimate zones 1 year after disturbance, ranging from approximately 42\% of disturbed pixels for the cold and mesic bioclimate zone to 60\% for the extremely cold and mesic bioclimate zone. The cold and mesic bioclimate zone had the longest mean years to recover ranging from 1.9~years for TCG to 4.2~years for NBR, while the cool temperate and dry bioclimate zone had the shortest mean years to recover ranging from 1.6~years for TCG to 2.9~years for NBR suggesting differences in pre-disturbance conditions or successional processes. The results highlight the need for caution when selecting and interpreting a spectral index for recovery characterization, as spectral indices, based upon the constituent wavelengths, are sensitive to different vegetation conditions and will provide a variable representation of structural conditions of forests.},

  abstract = {Urbanization causes the simplification of natural habitats, resulting in animal communities dominated by exotic species with few top predators. In recent years, however, many predators such as hawks, and in the US coyotes and cougars, have become increasingly common in urban environments. Hawks in the Accipiter genus, especially, are recovering from widespread population declines and are increasingly common in urbanizing landscapes. Our goal was to identify factors that determine the occupancy, colonization and persistence of Accipiter hawks in a major metropolitan area. Through a novel combination of citizen science and advanced remote sensing, we quantified how urban features facilitate the dynamics and long-term establishment of Accipiter hawks. Based on data from Project FeederWatch, we quantified 21 years (1996-2016) of changes in the spatio-temporal dynamics of Accipiter hawks in Chicago, IL, USA. Using a multi-season occupancy model, we estimated Cooper's (Accipiter cooperii) and sharp-shinned (A. striatus) hawk occupancy dynamics as a function of tree canopy cover, impervious surface cover and prey availability. In the late 1990s, hawks occupied 26\% of sites around Chicago, but after two decades, their occupancy fluctuated close to 67\% of sites and they colonized increasingly urbanized areas. Once established, hawks persisted in areas with high levels of impervious surfaces as long as those areas supported high abundances of prey birds. Urban areas represent increasingly habitable environments for recovering predators, and understanding the precise urban features that drive colonization and persistence is important for wildlife conservation in an urbanizing world.},

  abstract = {The `Natural Disturbance Paradigm' for forest management seeks to meet conservation goals by modeling industrial harvest in fire-driven forest systems on patterns associated with wildfire. Fire suppression and increased forest harvesting may have detrimental effects on biodiversity, and therefore prescribed burning is suggested to retain legacies of wildfire not emulated under natural disturbance based approaches. The merits of this approach are being tested in the EMEND experiment in the Canadian boreal mixedwood forest. We compared responses of ground-dwelling spiders between sites subjected to prescribed post-harvest burning and retention harvest during three seasons during the first 7 years after disturbance. Overall, 38,661 adult spiders representing 190 species were collected. Estimated species richness was highest in undisturbed sites in all 3 years. Burning had the strongest negative effect on species richness 1-2 years after treatment; however, richness was higher in burns than in harvested sites 5-6 years post-disturbance. Species turnover was highest within controls but tended to increase over time between burned and harvested plots. Lower turnover in burned and harvested sites may reflect habitat homogenization by disturbance, suggesting a management and conservation challenge in relation to naturally disturbed and undisturbed areas. Species were grouped into disturbance-specialists, disturbance-tolerant, disturbance-generalists and generalists; 22 species were significant indicators for untreated sites, 18 for the burn and three for the harvest treatments. No major differences were observed in the spider fauna between harvested and burned areas within the first 6-7 years post-disturbance, and little evidence of recovery toward the pre-harvest fauna was evidenced. However, long term experiments may improve understanding of natural disturbance processes and improve management of boreal forests.},

  abstract = {Green tree retention has been embraced as an alternative to large scale conventional clear-cutting aimed at managing the boreal forest in a more sustainable way. Ground-dwelling spider assemblages were studied 6 years after the application of variable retention harvesting practices (dispersed to 2\%, 10\% and 75\% retention vs. aggregated retention) in deciduous and coniferous dominated stands as part of the Ecosystem Management Emulating Natural Disturbances (EMEND) project in the mixedwood boreal forest of northwestern Canada. Overall, spider composition was dominated by open-habitat species, especially by the wolf spider Pardosa moesta Banks, in all harvest treatments. However, an important shift in species composition was observed in unharvested controls. Distinctive ground-dwelling spider assemblages were observed in each forest cover-type and these were highly affected by the various harvest treatments, especially in coniferous forests. From the 164 species collected, 37 were indicators for various combinations of forest type, harvesting treatment and retention level. Species richness was affected as harvesting intensity increased; however, greater impact was observed in dispersed retention than in aggregated retention, and in coniferous stands compared to the same treatment in deciduous stands. Dispersed retention, even at 10\%, seemed to mitigate adverse effects of harvesting on spider assemblages, but only in deciduous forests; however, important effects on biodiversity were observed in coniferous forests even after 75\% retention. Retention of aggregated patches was useful in maintaining forest specialist species after harvesting, but was more effective when applied together with dispersed retention. Responses of spider assemblages to harvesting seemed to be highly correlated with environmental changes. Green tree retention preserves some of the heterogeneity, structural features and environmental conditions required by forest specialist species and thus becomes an effective management practice to maintain forest biodiversity, especially when both aggregated and dispersed retention practices are applied together. However, the effectiveness of these practices varies depending on the forest cover-type prior to harvesting and the amount of post-harvest residual. This suggests that a single prescription is insufficient for maintaining landscape heterogeneity, and that a combination of prescriptions is supported for a more sustainable management of the mixedwood boreal forest.

To assess changes in spider composition because of harvesting, samples were collected from three forest layers (overstory, understory, and ground) of deciduous and conifer dominated stands in the northwestern Canadian boreal mixedwood forest. Spider assemblages and feeding guild composition were compared between uncut controls and stands harvested to 20\% retention. In total, 143 spider species were collected, 74 from the ground, 60 from the understory, and 71 from the overstory, and species composition of these three pools differed considerably among layers. Distinctive spider assemblages were collected from the canopy of each forest cover type but these were only slightly affected by harvesting. However, logging had a greater impact on the species composition in the understory and ground layers when compared with unharvested controls. Guild structure differed among layers, with wandering and sheet-weaving spiders dominant on the ground while orb-weaving and ambush spiders were better represented in the understory and overstory, respectively. Given the ecological importance of spiders and the expectation of faunal changes with increased harvesting, further efforts toward the understanding of species composition in higher strata of the boreal forest are needed.},

We studied epigaeic spiders to assess biodiversity changes 2, 5, and 10 yr following a range of partial retention harvests (clear-cut, 10-75\% retention) and unharvested controls in four boreal mixedwood cover types. A total of 56 371 adult spiders representing 220 species was collected using pitfall traps. Lasting effects on forest structure were proportional to harvest intensity. These changes strongly influenced spider richness, abundance, and species composition, as well as assemblage recovery. Distinctive assemblages were associated with disturbance level, especially with partial harvests ({$<$}= 50\% retention), and these were dominated by open-habitat species even 10 yr after harvest. Assemblages were more similar to those of controls in the highest (75\%) retention treatment, but significant recovery toward the structure of pre-disturbance assemblages was not detected for any prescription in any cover type. Although early responses to retention harvest suggested positive effects on spider assemblages, these are better explained as lag effects after harvest because assemblages were less similar to those of unharvested controls 5 yr post-harvest, and only minor recovery was observed 10 yr following harvest. Retention of forest biodiversity decreased over time, especially in conifer stands and the lower (10-50\%) retention treatments. Overall, retention harvests retained biodiversity and promoted landscape heterogeneity somewhat better than clear-cutting; however, there was a clear gradient of response and no retention ``threshold\{''\} for conservation can be recommended on the basis of our data. Furthermore, results suggest that retention harvest prescriptions should be adjusted for cover type. We show that low retention ameliorated impacts in broadleaved forests characteristic of earlier stages in mixedwood succession, but only higher retention was associated with less impact in successionally older conifer forests. Although these short-term responses (10 yr) of spider assemblages support use of retention harvests, understanding the true conservation merit of these practices, relative to conventional approaches, requires evaluation over longer time scales, with work more focused on recovery of biodiversity than on its preservation after harvest.},

  abstract = {Among vertebrates the concept of ``habitat tree\{''\} in temperate forests, involving tree size and microhabitat occurrence, has been investigated mainly for birds and mammals. However, trees are also used by many amphibian species or sometimes by whole amphibian families that have evolved adaptations for living on trees. While there is a self-evident link between arboreal amphibians, which occur mainly in tropical forests, and trees, the relationship between trees and forest ground-dwelling amphibians is less widely studied and more difficult to understand. As a consequence, the effect of forestry practices on amphibian communities are commonly considered at the landscape scale, identifying habitat alteration and loss as major threats. We provide the first evidence that the combination of forestry practices and species conservation strategies may act at a smaller scale than those traditionally adopted: the single tree scale. Our study focused on the Italian endemic spectacled salamander (Salamandrina perspicillata). In a hectare forest stand in central Italy we marked nearly 400 trees individually and for each we measured the DBH, the number of buttresses in the stump (BUT) and the number of cavities between soil and stump (HOL). Salamanders were sampled and individually marked at each tree in eleven sampling occasions, during 2013 and 2014. We discovered that the concept of ``habitat tree\{''\} may also hold for salamanders, and that DBH and HOL are the best predictors of tree suitability for salamanders. Moreover, using the number of captures for the same individuals on the same tree, occurring in different years, we were able to distinguish between trees that act as permanent or temporary shelters for salamanders. Permanent shelters were not only used by the same individuals in different years, but also hosted a larger number of salamanders, and were characterized by a larger number of HOL. Our findings may be considered of importance for drawing up forest management plans and achieving conservation objectives. During forest harvest operations, for the purpose of salamander conservation we suggest retaining trees with a larger DBH ({$>$}30 cm) and a high number of HOL. Finally, since BUT is highly correlated with HOL but is less sensitive to variations during time, we suggest this parameter be used as a proxy of HOL. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We synthesized 46 studies from the peer-reviewed literature to provide the first-ever review on the subject. Our analysis showed that spectral and structural data from UAS imagery can accurately estimate vegetation biomass in a variety of settings, especially when both data types are combined. Vegetation-height metrics are useful for trees, while metrics of variation in structure or volume are better for non-woody vegetation. Multispectral indices using NIR and red-edge wavelengths normally have strong relationships with AGB but RGB-based indices often outperform them in models. Including measures of image texture can improve model accuracy for vegetation with heterogeneous canopies. Vegetation growth structure and phenological stage strongly influence model accuracy and the selection of useful metrics and should be considered carefully. Additional factors related to the study environment, data collection and analytical approach also impact biomass estimation and need to be considered throughout the workflow. Our review shows that UASs provide a capable tool for fine-scale, spatially explicit estimations of vegetation AGB and are an ideal complement to existing ground- and satellite-based approaches. We recommend future studies aimed at emerging UAS technologies and at evaluating the effect of vegetation type and growth stages on AGB estimation.},

Pinus banksiana, P. resinosa and Pinus strobus seedlings in dispersed retention, aggregated retention between small gaps and aggregated retention between large gaps treatments had greater delta C-13, A(max), g(s), diameter and height than seedlings in unharvested treatments, but seedling performance was similar among VRH treatments when averaged across stands. There were no significant differences in delta O-18 associated with any treatment. These results indicate seedling photosynthetic capacity, water relations and growth were improved by VRH, but the spatial pattern of retention had surprisingly little impact on average performance in the first 4 years after harvesting. This suggests retention treatments that produce different residual stand structures can promote similar mean rates of early seedling development when performance is averaged across all of the neighbourhood environments within each treatment.},

  abstract = {Canadian boreal woodlands and forests cover approximately 3.09 \texttimes{} 106 km2, located within a larger boreal zone characterized by cool summers and long cold winters. Warming since the 1850s, increases in annual mean temperature of at least 2 C between 2000 and 2050 are highly probable. Annual mean temperatures across the Canadian boreal zone could be 4-5 C warmer than today's by 2100. All aspects of boreal forest ecosystem function are likely to be affected. Further, several potential "tipping elements"-where exposure to increasing changes in climate may trigger distinct shifts in ecosystem state-can be identified across the Canadian boreal zone. Approximately 40\% of the forested area is underlain by permafrost, some of which is already degrading irreversibly, triggering a process of forest decline and re-establishment lasting several decades, while also releasing significant quantities of greenhouse gases that will amplify the future global warming trend. Warmer temperatures coupled with significant changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation are likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts in the west; east of the Great Lakes, however, where precipitation is generally nonlimiting, warming coupled with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may stimulate higher forest productivity. Large wildfires, which can cause serious economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in mean annual area burned will be relatively gradual. The most immediate threats could come from endemic forest insect pests that have the potential for population outbreaks in response to relatively small temperature increases. Quantifying the multiple effects of climate change will be challenging, particularly because there are great uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as with other land-use pressures. Considerable ingenuity will be needed from forest managers and scientists to address the formidable challenges posed by climate change to boreal ecosystems and develop effective strategies to adapt sustainable forest management practices to the impending changes. \textcopyright{} 2013 Published by NRC Research Press.},

  abstract = {Retention forestry aims to maintain structural and functional continuity in managed stands. While short-term benefits to forest dwellers are well documented, few studies have followed patterns over decades to assess whether benefits continue. Initiated in 1992, the Date Creek Research Forest in northwest BC includes four replicates of four retention levels: 0\% (clearcut), 40\%, 70\% and 100\% (unharvested control). These \textasciitilde 20-hectare stands, with retention designed to mimic typical insect and wind disturbance, are now entering the canopy closure seral stage. We followed breeding bird community dynamics over 25 years (pre-harvest and 24 years post-harvest). Given relatively consistent landscape conditions over time, we focused on stand-level changes in bird community composition and species abundance. Community similarity to controls decreased as retention decreased; communities changed over time, with those in clearcuts changing most. Patterns in species abundance varied with habitat preference. Conifer-forest species declined immediately after harvest, with some responding linearly to retention level while others responded similarly to 40\%, 70\% and 100\% treatments; Pacific Slope Flycatcher, Pacific Wren and Brown Creeper remained significantly less abundant in some treatments by year 24. Open-habitat and generalist species increased most in clearcut and somewhat in 40\% retention stands, with generalists taking advantage of the increased heterogeneity immediately and open-habitat species colonizing by year 10; some of these species, particularly shrub specialists, remained at high abundance in harvested stands in year 24. Mixed-forest species reached their highest abundance at 40\% retention in year 2 and 10, and dropped to control levels by year 24. Although conifer-forest, open-habitat and generalist species treated retention stands as intermediate between clearcuts and controls, mixed-forest species perceived them as a different, preferred habitat for the first decade. We conclude first that most forest birds do not discriminate between 70\% retention stands and unharvested forest, confirming strategies in the region to maintain biodiversity in landscape corridors, second that aggregated 40\% patch retention partially or fully mitigates impacts for conifer-forest birds, and provides new habitat for mixed-forest and open-habitat species, and third that bird communities are still changing after 24 years as these stands enter canopy closure.},

  abstract = {European beech is one of the most important European trees, not only because of its expected role in the face of climate change, but also as a frequent species in forest reserves, national parks and the NATURA 2000 network. For such areas, naturalness and biodiversity conservation are significant issues, in which the presence of deadwood plays an important role. To manage deadwood in forests, one needs to know how the residence time of coarse woody debris is influenced by the environment. In this study, we analysed a dataset of 4260 logs from beech-dominated primeval and natural forest reserves in three climatically different regions (cold-dry, warm-dry and warm-humid region), working with a time series of more than 40 years (1972-2015). With the help of Bayesian Survival Trajectory Analysis, we examined differences between residence times in the three regions and in three DBH classes. In addition, we analysed qualitative characteristics of fallen logs - the mortality mode and the position of logs during decomposition - and calculated their total decomposition time and time to reach an advanced decay stage. The analyses confirmed the significant impact of macroclimate on residence time. In the cold-dry region the diameter classes 10-24 cm (small-sized logs) and 25-54 cm (medium-sized logs) had the longest residence time (38 and 48 years, respectively). In the warm-dry region with a favourable composition of fungal communities, the diameter class 55+ cm (large-sized logs) logs had the shortest residence time (43 years). The rates of decomposition of beech logs in contact with the ground or suspended logs were significantly different in all three regions, with logs lying on the ground decomposing 9-15 years sooner. These results can be used in retention forestry. If the continuity of the deadwood environment is to be preserved, it is necessary to ensure a ``supply\{''\} of dead stems (offering differing habitats) at least once every 24-35 years. During this period, 50\% of logs decay completely and the other 50\% of logs progress to an advanced decay stage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

DIV DIVThe book includes an overview of the historical developments of silvicultural techniques and describes how these developments are best understood in their contemporary philosophical, social, and ecological contexts. It also explains how the traditional strengths of silviculture are becoming limitations as society demands a varied set of benefits from forests and as we learn more about the importance of diversity on ecosystem functions and processes. DIV DIVThe authors go on to explain how other fields, specifically ecology and complexity science, have developed in attempts to understand the diversity of nature and the variability and heterogeneity of ecosystems. The authors suggest that ideas and approaches from these fields could offer a road map to a new philosophical and practical approach that endorses managing forests as complex adaptive systems. DIV DIVA Critique of Silviculture bridges a gap between silviculture and ecology that has long hindered the adoption of new ideas.

However, parties interested in monitoring CWD abundance lack accurate methods to measure CWD accurately and extensively. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy for mapping CWD volume (m3) across a 4300-hectare study area in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada using optical imagery and an infra-canopy vegetation-index layer derived from multispectral aerial LiDAR. Our models predicted CWD volume with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.62 compared to field data, and a root-mean square error (RMSE) of 0.224 m3/100 m2. Models using multispectral LiDAR data in addition to image-analysis data performed with up to 12\% lower RMSE than models using exclusively image-analysis layers. Site managers and researchers requiring reliable and comprehensive maps of CWD volume may benefit from the presented workflow, which aims to streamline the process of CWD measurement. As multispectral LiDAR radiometric calibration routines are developed and standardized, we expect future studies to benefit increasingly more from such products for CWD detection underneath canopy cover.},

This study illustrates how the use of species distribution models that combine remote sensing data and information about biodiversity surrogates can contribute to develop a systematic protocol for monitoring PAs. In particular, we assessed the effectiveness of the Natura 2000 (N2000) network, for conserving and preserving the representativeness of seven raptor species in a highly-dynamic landscape in northwest Spain between 2001 and 2014. We also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the N2000 network by using the total area under protection as a proxy for conservation costs. Overall, the N2000 network was found to poorly represent the habitats of the raptor species. Despite the low representativeness, this network showed a high degree of effectiveness due to increased overall habitat availability for generalist and forest specialist species between 2001 and 2014. Nevertheless, additional protected areas should be established in the near future to increase their representativeness, and thus ensure the protection of open-habitat specialist species and their priority habitats. In addition, proactive conservation measures in natural and semi-natural ecosystems (in particular, montane heathlands) will be essential for long-term protection of Montagu's harrier (species listed in the Annex I of the Bird Directive), and thus complying with the current European Environmental Legislation. This study sheds light on how the development and application of new protected area indices based on the combined use of freely-available satellite data and species distribution models may contribute substantially to the cost-efficiency of the PA monitoring systems, and to the 'Fitness Check' process of EU Nature Directives.},

Model performance may also be affected by species traits, which may reflect different responses to processes controlling species distribution. In this study, we tested four primary hypotheses involving the role of species traits and environmental predictors in ENM performance and transferability. We compared the predictive accuracy of ENMs based upon (1) climate, (2) land-use/cover (LULC) and (3) ecosystem functional attributes (EFAs), and (4) the combination of these factors for 27 bird species within and beyond the time frame of model calibration. The combination of these factors significantly increased both model performance and transferability, highlighting the need to integrate climate, LULC and EFAs to improve biodiversity projections. However, the overall model transferability was low (being only acceptable for less than 25\% of species), even under a hierarchical modelling approach, which calls for great caution in the use of ENMs to predict bird distributions under global change scenarios. Our findings also indicate that positive effects of species traits on predictive accuracy within model calibration are not necessarily translated into higher temporal transferability.},

Our goal was to determine how species richness in several broad taxonomic groups from remnant forest was influenced by matrix quality, which we characterized by comparing plant biomass in forest and the surrounding matrix. We coupled data on species-area relationships (SARs) in forest remnants from 45 previously published studies with an index of matrix quality calculated using new estimates of plant biomass derived from satellite imagery. The effect size of SARs was greatest in landscapes with low matrix quality and little forest cover. SARs were generally stronger for volant than for non-volant species. For the terrestrial taxa included in our analysis, matrix quality decreased as the proportion of water, ice, or urbanization in a landscape increased. We clearly demonstrate that matrix quality plays a major role in determining patterns of species richness in remnant forest. A key implication of our work is that activities that increase matrix quality, such as active and passive habitat restoration, may be important conservation measure for maintaining and restoring biodiversity in modified landscapes.},

  abstract = {Conservation of biodiversity is now a firmly entrenched objective of sustainable forest management, and emulating natural disturbance has been widely adopted as a conservation strategy. Yet the foundation for this approach is still very much a hypothesis based on first principles, and there has been little rigorous testing of the approach. In addition, practical constraints mean that the full range and character of natural patterns can never be implemented, so decisions must still be made in setting forest management targets and levels. An alternative, but complementary approach is to select a focal group of species and use their habitat requirements to define the range of conditions that should be maintained on the landscape. In this study, I used a balanced factorial sample design to test the effect of landscape vs. local scale factors for explaining relative abundance of 30 forest songbird species in boreal Ontario, and then examined components of variance, and used multivariate analysis and logistic regression to describe these relationships in more detail. Based on statistically defendable inferences and habitat model coefficients, 13 species were selected, with habitat associations ranging from high to low edge density, homogeneous to heterogeneous forest matrix, hardwood to softwood dominated overstory, young to old stands, and open to closed canopy. I found that variations in amount and configuration of mature forest cover had relatively little influence on the overall boreal forest songbird community, but that individual species differ in their response to these variables. To be successful, biodiversity conservation strategies must emulate the patterns created through natural disturbance by maintaining the full range of forest cover homogeneity and heterogeneity on the landscape. The habitat requirements for Alder Flycatcher, Black-and-white Warbler, Bay-breasted Warbler, Blackburnian Warbler, Brown Creeper, Common Yellowthroat, Chestnut-sided Warbler, Least Flycatcher, Ovenbird, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Red-eyed Vireo, Winter Wren, and White- throated Sparrow describe a broad range of habitat conditions that, at a minimum, describe necessary coarse-filter conditions to sustain the boreal songbird community in Ontario. This suite of species can also serve in developing a ``bioassay'' to evaluate the effectiveness of forest policy to conserve biodiversity through emulation of natural disturbance.},

However, how structural heterogeneity at the stand level of differently managed forests drives species richness across taxa is not clear. Here we analyze how birds and bats, sharing the ability to fly, respond to the structural composition of the vegetation layers in differently managed forests. We combined datasets of birds and bats and compared their response as taxonomic vs. functional richness towards forest structure. Overall our results revealed that bird and bat species richness were positively correlated and spedei richness of both taxa peaked within the same forest stands. In contrast to our prediction that richness of mobile vertebrates with similar ecological traits (the ability to fly) should respond alike to forest stand characteristics, our results showed almost no congruence. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Modeling (GLMM) with model selection based on AICc and model averaging, we found that taxonomic richness of birds and bats as well as functional richness (based on main diet and foraging mode) responded to forest structure in very different ways. While the taxonomic richness of birds was mainly associated with the structural parameters contrast and forest height, representing tall trees and a relatively closed canopy, richness of bat species increased with vertical and horizontal heterogeneity within forest stands. Our findings indicate that functional richness is more useful to understand responses of bird and bats species richness to land use, forest structure and forest management, rather than focusing solely on taxonomic groups.},

  abstract = {Perceptions of the acceptability of alternative ``variable retention\{''\} timber harvests, that keep trees standing in harvested areas, were compared between regions beset by major forestry conflicts. Data from similar studies of similar harvest systems were compared between Oregon and Tasmania. These comparisons were related to attitudes and to differences in ecosystems, silvicultural prescriptions, forestry outcomes, aesthetics, and social-political context. Findings showed that perceptions measured in one region cannot be assumed valid in another. Substantial regional differences arose not from general sociological differences but from differences in local forestry outcomes. These largely arose from different regeneration requirements of commercial tree species and consequent differences in the design of otherwise analogous harvests. Comparisons of perceptions by people with similar attitudes yielded substantial regional differences. Those prioritizing ecological conservation were mainly influenced by habitat outcomes, and consequently preferred harvests with aggregated tree retention patterns in Tasmania but not in Oregon. People sympathetic to timber industry interests in both regions showed little association between forestry outcomes and acceptability and favoured more intensive harvests. Tasmanian harvest advocates perceived harvests that keep more standing trees as less acceptable than those in Oregon. This may be due to sampling differences or to greater risk perceptions towards new harvest designs in Tasmania. Tasmanians generally disliked clearfelling more than Oregonians, likely due to different political narratives framing these perceptions or to higher aesthetic impacts in Tasmania due to burning. Dispersed retention was perceived as more acceptable in Oregon than in Tasmania, likely because Oregon had much higher post-harvest tree densities. Regional differences in wildfire-risk and logger-safety were not strongly associated with different acceptability perceptions because these were confounded by other more influential concerns. More and better cross-regional studies of environmental perceptions are needed and would benefit from more standardized or coordinated methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Tensions between amenity- and timber-based economies in the U.S. and Canadian Pacific Northwest motivated a study of scenic beauty inside mature forests and timber harvests. A diverse sample of regional forests, measures of forest structure, and large, representative samples of photographs and public judges were employed to measure scenic beauty inside un-harvested mature and old-growth forests, and timber harvests. The latter varied systematically in down wood levels and retention level and pattern. Scenic beauty tended to be optimized at a basal area of 110-155 m(3)/ha and/or 700-900 trees/ha. Older forests and those with larger trees were perceived to be more beautiful. In harvests, greater retention levels, less down wood, and dispersed rather than aggregated retention patterns contributed to aesthetic improvements. Green-tree retention harvests offer considerable potential gains in perceived scenic beauty compared to perceived very ugly clearcuts, particularly at higher retention levels. These gains are more reliable from dispersed retention patterns. The silvicultural parameters studied change strength in affecting scenic beauty with changes in retention level. These interactions are explored in relation to a range of scenic quality objectives as an aid to planners, visual impact analysts, and silviculturists. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Satellite images were chosen according to the agricultural calendar, among those freely available, i. e. Landsat images. The results appear satisfactory on a local scale, where ground control points have been chosen. But the generalization to the entire images shows the limits to map the landscapes from satellite images. Ground survey points are to be chosen on the entire area. Thus, the advantage of satellite images to generalize the knowledge of landscapes disappears.},

Concerns about loss of biodiversity and structural complexity in managed forests have recently increased and led to the development of new management strategies focused on restoring or maintaining ecosystem functions while also providing wood outputs. Variable retention harvest (VRH) systems, in which mature overstorey trees are retained in various spatial arrangements across harvested areas, represent one potential approach to this prob- lem. However, long-term evaluations of the effectiveness of this strategy at sustaining plant community composition are needed as this strategy is increasingly applied in managed forest landscapes throughout the world. 2. The forest ground layer plays a central role in forest ecosystem functioning, and we evalu- ated the long-term (11+ year) dynamics in ground-layer plant communities in response to VRH study in Pinus resinosa Aiton. forests. This large-scale, manipulative study included four overstorey (control, small gap-aggregated, large gap-aggregated and dispersed) and two understorey (ambient and reduced shrubs) treatments replicated four times in 16-ha stands. 3. Changes in ground-layer community composition were apparent 11 years following har- vest, regardless of live-tree retention pattern. Richness and diversity increased and were driven by introduction and colonization of ruderal species, while forest interior species continued to persist across treatments. All life-forms responded positively to harvest with the exception of moss and clubmoss species. 4. The lack of effect of spatial pattern of retention on ground-layer plant communities was likely related to the presence of a dense and persistent shrub layer, a result of decades of fire suppression. In particular, the greatest responses to overstorey retention pattern occurred in areas receiving shrub reduction treatments, indicating this recalcitrant layer likely filtered response to retention pattern. 5.

Variable Retention Harvest (VRH) practices, which maintain mature overstory trees across harvested areas, have been suggested as an approach to balance these objectives; however, long-term evaluations of outcomes of VRH strategies do not exist for most forest types. The objective of this study was to determine the 11-year effects of overstory tree retention pattern and shrub removal on regeneration in P. resinosa forests in Minnesota, USA using a large-scale manipulative study in which four overstory (control, small gap-aggregated, large gap-aggregated, and dispersed) and two shrub (ambient and reduced shrubs) treatments were applied. Hardwood regeneration greatly outnumbered conifer regeneration and several mechanisms (disease, browse, and seedbed conditions) likely interacted to limit P. resinosa regeneration across treatments. The presence of recalcitrant shrub layers filtered response to retention with regeneration of P. strobus L. being greater under an intact Corylus layer irrespective of overstory conditions. This work reinforced the importance of accounting for shrub competition when designing VRH to secure natural regeneration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this study, we assessed how two methods aimed to promote biodiversity, i.e. prescribed fire and retention forestry (RET), affect ecosystem services supported by bilberry and lingonberry in Scots pine-dominated boreal forests. Shrub cover, flowering, berry yield and percent fruit set of both shrubs were measured and bees were sampled by pan-traps on 24 study sites 13 years following a large-scale experiment, where RET (0, 10, 50 m(3)/ha and uncut forests) and fire (yes/no) were manipulated following a replicated factorial design. In general, bilberry performance and reproduction were higher at uncut sites, while lingonberly flowering was positively affected by fire and retention. Bee community composition was mainly determined by percentage of bare ground and number of logs within sites, both nesting resources largely determined by fire and retention. Burnt sites with retention trees serve as pollinator source habitats and contain floral resources, highlighting the importance of natural disturbances and biological legacies in the conservation of pollination services from boreal forests.

  abstract = {Green-tree retention cutting (GTR) is a modification of traditional clear-cutting, aimed at better consideration of biodiversity. We reviewed 214 North American and European studies to answer whether, and under which circumstances, GTR meets its objectives: 'lifeboats' species over the regeneration phase, provides microhabitats for old-forest species in re-established forest stands and for disturbance-phase species on the recent cuts, and enhances species' dispersal by increasing landscape connectivity. To answer these questions is complicated, partly because the target taxa differ regionally and due to research biases: 81\% of the studies have been carried out in North America, 82\% have been short term, and the objective of improving landscape connectivity has not been studied. A meta-analysis of GTR effects on species richness and abundance of different taxa indicated no negative responses, but birds and ectomycorrhizal fungi benefited most. Compared with clear-cutting, GTR lowered the harvest-related loss of populations or individuals in 72\% of studies, and it nearly always improved the habitat for disturbance-phase insects and birds on the cuts and for forest species in the regenerated stand. Lifeboating was most successful for ectomycorrhizal fungi, epiphytic lichens and small ground-dwelling animals, and least successful for bryophytes and vascular plants. Retention tree species always contributed to the success of GTR, followed by tree density (65\% of cases) and the spatial arrangement of the trees (50\%); the influence of forest type is likely, but insufficiently studied. Ectomycorrhizal fungi, epiphytes, birds, and wood-dependent beetles may be suitable indicator taxa for measuring the success of GTR. For future research, we encourage clearly objective oriented studies of relevant taxa, spatially explicit landscape perspectives, and long-term (including retrospective) studies. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

There are no practical solutions yet, but selection for resistant genotypes and intensive care have been highlighted as options. Our aim was to assess the disease mitigation potential of silvicultural harvests, which influence stress levels in retained trees. We annually monitored 577 retention trees on Estonian cut areas for 13 years, including 9 years impacted by the dieback. Sixty-five percent of the trees survived and 15\% retained healthy crown, despite all sampled trees being infected. The damage was smallest in the trees retained near precut edges. Former forest-interior trees that were left in central parts of the cut areas suffered high initial damage but smaller disease progression than trees near postcut edges. Tree size and secondary infection by Armillaria spp. were not related to disease progression, but rapid decline was observed in the region with the highest density of ash trees retained. Our results indicate a significant silvicultural potential for tree resistance. Ash trees tend to be healthiest in open conditions, which probably inhibit the pathogen and provide better resources for the tree.

  abstract = {In an effort to increase conservation effectiveness through the use of Earth observation technologies, a group of remote sensing scientists affiliated with government and academic institutions and conservation organizations identified 10 questions in conservation for which the potential to be answered would be greatly increased by use of remotely sensed data and analyses of those data. Our goals were to increase conservation practitioners' use of remote sensing to support their work, increase collaboration between the conservation science and remote sensing communities, identify and develop new and innovative uses of remote sensing for advancing conservation science, provide guidance to space agencies on how future satellite missions can support conservation science, and generate support from the public and private sector in the use of remote sensing data to address the 10 conservation questions. We identified a broad initial list of questions on the basis of an email chain-referral survey. We then used a workshop-based iterative and collaborative approach to whittle the list down to these final questions (which represent 10 major themes in conservation): How can global Earth observation data be used to model species distributions and abundances? How can remote sensing improve the understanding of animal movements? How can remotely sensed ecosystem variables be used to understand, monitor, and predict ecosystem response and resilience to multiple stressors? How can remote sensing be used to monitor the effects of climate on ecosystems? How can near real-time ecosystem monitoring catalyze threat reduction, governance and regulation compliance, and resource management decisions? How can remote sensing inform configuration of protected area networks at spatial extents relevant to populations of target species and ecosystem services? How can remote sensing-derived products be used to value and monitor changes in ecosystem services? How can remote sensing be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts? How does the expansion and intensification of agriculture and aquaculture alter ecosystems and the services they provide? How can remote sensing be used to determine the degree to which ecosystems are being disturbed or degraded and the effects of these changes on species and ecosystem functions?.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have many ways to measure and monitor ecosystems, each of which can reveal details about the processes unfolding therein. Acoustic recording combined with machine learning methods for species detection can provide remote, automated monitoring of species richness and relative abundance. Such recordings also open a window into how species behave and compete for niche space in the sensory environment. These opportunities are associated with new challenges: the volume and velocity of such data require new approaches to species identification and visualization. Here we introduce a newly-initiated acoustic monitoring network across the subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan, as part of the broader OKEON (Okinawa Environmental Observation Network) project. Our aim is to monitor the acoustic environment of Okinawa's ecosystems and use these space\textendash time data to better understand ecosystem dynamics. We present a pilot study based on recordings from five field sites conducted over a one-month period in the summer. Our results provide a proof of concept for automated species identification on Okinawa, and reveal patterns of biogenic vs. anthropogenic noise across the landscape. In particular, we found correlations between forest land cover and detection rates of two culturally important species in the island soundscape: the Okinawa Rail and Ruddy Kingfisher. Among the soundscape indices we examined, NDSI, Acoustic Diversity and the Bioacoustic Index showed both diurnal patterns and differences among sites. Our results highlight the potential utility of remote acoustic monitoring practices that, in combination with other methods can provide a holistic picture of biodiversity. We intend this project as an open resource, and wish to extend an invitation to researchers interested in scientific collaboration.},

  abstract = {Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

  abstract = {Species adapted to early-successional forest habitats are in managed landscapes largely confined to clearcuts. To improve habitat quality on clearcuts, green tree and dead wood retention is widely applied in forestry; however, its effects on rare early-successional species have rarely been shown. We repeatedly surveyed two red-listed beetle species (Upis ceramboides and Platysoma minus) on clearcuts in a managed boreal forest landscape. We found that U. ceramboides decreased its occupancy over time while P. minus increased, indicating that red-listed species vary in their ability to successfully utilise managed habitats. We found no effect of connectivity on probability of occurrence, colonisation or extinction per clearcut. Trees retained alive improved habitat quality of clearcuts, since both species were more frequent in dead wood of such trees, in comparison to logging residues. We suggest that retention can be improved by protecting and creating dead wood as intact trees during harvesting. Rare specialist species require habitat of high quality, and consequently it is impossible to meet the requirements of these species on every clearcut. To preserve all early-successional species at a regional scale, we recommend focusing retention of green trees and dead wood to one or a few trees species on each clearcut and in each landscape.},

  abstract = {Clearcutting has been identified as a main threat to forest biodiversity. In the last few decades, alternatives to clearcutting have gained much interest. Living and dead trees are often retained after harvest to serve as structural legacies to mitigate negative effects of forestry. However, this practice is widely employed without information from systematic before-after control-impact studies to assess the processes involved in species responses after clearcutting with retention. We performed a large-scale survey of the occurrence of logging-sensitive and red-listed bryophytes and lichens before and after clearcutting with the retention approach. A methodology was adopted that, for the first time in studies on retention approaches, enabled monitoring of location-specific substrates. We used uncut stands as controls to assess the variables affecting the survival of species after a major disturbance. In total, 12 bryophyte species and 27 lichen species were analysed. All were classified as sensitive to logging, and most species are also currently red-listed. We found that living and dead trees retained after final harvest acted as refugia in which logging-sensitive species were able to survive for 3 to 7years after logging. Depending on type of retention and organism group, between 35\% and 92\% of the species occurrences persisted on retained structures. Most species observed outside retention trees or patches disappeared. Larger pre-harvest population sizes of bryophytes on dead wood increased the survival probability of the species and hence buffered the negative effects of logging.Synthesis and applications. Careful spatial planning of retention structures is required to fully embrace the habitats of logging-sensitive species. Bryophytes and lichens persisted to a higher degree in retention patches compared to solitary trees or in the clearcut area. Retaining groups of trees in logged areas will help to sustain populations of species over the clearcut phase. When possible, old logs should be moved into retention patches to provide a more beneficial environment for dead wood-dependent species. Our study also highlights the need for more before-after control-impact studies of retention forestry to explore factors influencing the survival of species after logging.

  abstract = {Understanding maternity roost requirements is fundamental to guide timber production forest management given such roosts are vital to sustain bat populations. We tracked lactating females of three tree cavity-roosting species: Gould's long-eared bat (Nyctophilus gouldi) (n = 7), eastern broad-nosed bat (Scotorepens orion) (n = 6) and little forest bat (Vespadelus vulturous) (n = 25), over five weeks in young (predominately {$<$}5 years old) forest regenerating from heavy timber harvest in southeast Australia. We aimed to investigate interspecific maternity roost selection in a regenerating landscape and by doing so, increase our understanding of the three species' roost ecology. Sixteen V. vulturous, 15 N. gouldi and six S. orion unique maternity roost trees were located. Bats displayed a degree of maternity roost selection plasticity, however, interspecific differences were found. Nyctophilus gouldi roosted selectively in retained riparian buffers, in trees of high senescence and switched roosts every day. Vespadelus vulturous roosted in logged areas and displayed high roost site fidelity, with one roost used for 33 consecutive days. Scotorepens orion selected large live trees of low senescence. The preliminary data for this species suggests that females roost most days in `primary' roosts but display a roost switching behaviour conforming to the fission-fusion model. Dead trees were identified to be important for both N. gouldi and V. vulturnus. Historical and recent logging at our study area drastically reduced cavity-bearing tree density to 1.4 trees per hectare in the logging zones (outside of exclusion areas), potentially limiting local populations of tree cavity-roosting bats and other cavity-dependent wildlife. Our data demonstrate that forest management must consider a range of maternity roost requirements to accommodate differences among species and highlight the importance of exclusion areas for roost habitat. We propose that an expanded `retention forestry' approach should be implemented in logged areas that includes in-perpetuity forest patch retention to increase habitat complexity and continuity.},

  abstract = {Context. Tree cavities suitable to rear young are a key resource in managed landscapes to support viable populations of tree cavity-roosting bats. Little is known about the selection of cavities for maternity roosts, presumably because of the difficulty in accessing such roosts. Aims. Our study investigated physical and microclimate characteristics of maternity roosts of two species, namely, Gould's long-eared bat (Nyctophilus gouldi) and little forest bat (Vespadelus vulturnus). Methods. Maternity-roost cavities were identified in a timber-production landscape in south-eastern Australia. Roost trees (V. vulturnus n= 5; N. gouldi n = 9) and a subsample of available cavity-bearing trees (n = 16) were climbed to obtain cavity characteristics. Key results. Vespadelus vulturnus used tree hollows exclusively, whereas N. gouldi used both tree hollows (n= 7) and thick loose bark (n = 2). No significant difference in roost-cavity characteristics was detected between the species. However, V. vulturnus selected significantly narrower cavity entrances (mean: 16 +/- 3 mm) than those of the available cavities. Temperature did not differ between maternity roosts and available cavities when investigated after the maternity season. However, a V. vulturnus maternity roost occupied for 33 consecutive days was warmer than mean roost and available cavities, suggesting that long-term roost use may be influenced by the thermal property of a cavity. Conclusions. Our study has provided the first detailed tree-cavity description of maternity roosts of N. gouldi and V. vulturnus. The nightly roost switching and the large variation of tree-cavity characteristics used by N. gouldi suggest that this species requires a high density of non-specific tree cavities that are large enough for colony formation, whereas preferred roost cavities for V. vulturnus are likely to be hollows comprising narrow entrances that facilitate long-term use.},

Here, we investigate the spatial distribution of 9470 habitat patches, mapped according to the Complementary Habitat Inventory method (CHI habitats), as potential WKHs in 10 sample areas in Norway. We ask whether there are parts of the forest landscapes that have consistently low or high density of CHI habitats compared to the surveyed landscape as a whole, and therefore have a low or high degree of conflict with harvesting, respectively. We found that there was a general pattern of clumped distribution of CHI habitats at distances up to a few kilometres. Furthermore, results showed that most types of CHI habitats were approximately two to three times as common in the 25\% steepest slopes, lowest altitudes and highest site indices. CHI habitats that are most common in old-growth forests were found at longer distances from roads, whereas habitats rich in deciduous trees were found at shorter distances from roads than expected. Both environmental factors and the history of human impact are needed to explain the spatial distribution of CHI habitats. The overrepresentation of WKHs in parts of the forest landscapes represents a good starting point to develop more efficient inventory methods.},

  abstract = {Climate variation and trends affect species distribution and abundance across large spatial extents. However, most studies that predict species response to climate are implemented at small spatial scales or are based on occurrence-environment relationships that lack mechanistic detail. Here, we develop an integrated population model (IPM) for multi-site count and capture-recapture data for a declining migratory songbird, Wilson's warbler (Cardellina pusilla), in three genetically distinct breeding populations in western North America. We include climate covariates of vital rates, including spring temperatures on the breeding grounds, drought on the wintering range in northwest Mexico, and wind conditions during spring migration. Spring temperatures were positively related to productivity in Sierra Nevada and Pacific Northwest genetic groups, and annual changes in productivity were important pre-dictors of changes in growth rate in these populations. Drought condition on the wintering grounds was a strong predictor of adult survival for coastal California and Sierra Nevada populations; however, adult survival played a relatively minor role in explaining annual variation in population change. A latent parameter representing a mixture of first-year survival and immigration was the largest contributor to variation in population change; however, this parameter was estimated imprecisely, and its importance likely reflects, in part, differences in spatio-temporal distribution of samples between count and capture-recapture data sets. Our modeling approach represents a novel and flexible framework for linking broad-scale multi-site monitoring data sets. Our results highlight both the potential of the approach for extension to additional species and systems, as well as needs for additional data and/or model development.

In the boreal zone, harvesting and management of forests on an industrial scale is the most important factor driving habitat change and degradation. Over time different forest management regimes have been implemented but their impact on biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales has not been systematically reviewed although non-systematic reviews on the topic exist. The aim of this article is to describe a protocol for a systematic review to synthesise and compare the impacts of two different forest management systems on biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales. The topic for the systematic review arose from the discussions with the Finnish forestry sector and was further defined in a stakeholder workshop. Research questions addressed by the systematic review protocol are: (1) What are the stand-level effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on boreal forest biodiversity in Fennoscandia and European Russia? (2) What is the effect of these same forest management systems on biodiversity at landscape level?MethodsAnimal, plant, and fungal diversity is addressed. Bibliographic databases and organizational websites will be searched, and internet search engines will be utilized to find relevant literature. The searches will be conducted in English, Finnish, Swedish, and Russian. Articles will be screened regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria at title, abstract, and full-text stage. The validity of included studies will be evaluated against appraisal criteria and studies categorized based on their risk of bias. A narrative synthesis will be conducted to describe the findings.

  abstract = {Over 50\% of Western Hemisphere shorebird species are in decline due to ongoing habitat loss and degradation. In some regions of high wetland loss, shorebirds are heavily reliant on a core network of remaining human-managed wetlands during migration journeys in the spring and fall. While most refuges have been designed and managed to match the habitat needs of waterfowl, shorebirds typically require much shallower water ({$<$}10cm deep). Traditional static habitat modeling approaches at relatively coarse spatial and temporal resolution are insufficient to capture dynamic changes within this narrow water depth range. Our objectives were to (1) develop a method to quantify shallow water habitat distributions in inland non-tidal wetlands, and (2) to assess how water management practices affect the amount of shorebird habitat in Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex. We produced water depth distributions and modeled optimal habitat ({$<$}10cm deep) within 23 managed wetlands using high-resolution topography and fixed-point water depth records. We also demonstrated that habitat availability, specifically suitable water depth ranges, can be tracked from satellite imagery and high-resolution topography. We found that wetlands with lower topographic roughness may have a higher potential to provide shorebird habitat and that strategically reducing water levels could increase habitat extent. Over 50\% of the wetlands measured provided optimal habitat across {$<$}10\% of their area at the peak of migration in early April, and most provided a brief duration of shallow water habitat. Reducing water volumes could increase the proportion of optimal habitat by 1-1,678\% (mean=294\%) compared to actual volumes measured at peak spring migration in 2016. For wetlands with a high habitat potential, beginning wetland drawdown earlier and extending drawdown time could dramatically improve habitat conditions at the peak of shorebird migration. Our approach can be adapted to track dynamic hydrologic changes at broader spatial scales as additional high-resolution topographic (e.g., lidar, drone imagery photogrammetry) and optical remote sensing data (e.g., planet imagery, drone photography) become available.},

Trees with large size or high age are usually preferred as retention trees. In this paper we investigated whether a single large or several small trees should be left in clear-felling areas to serve as life boats and future habitat for epiphytic species. The focal species were 25 Lobarion epiphytic lichens hosted by aspen (Populus tremula). We analyzed the relationships between: (1) proportion of trees colonized and tree size, (2) number of lichen thalli (lichen bodies) and aspen area, and (3) number of lichen species and aspen area, for 38 forest sites. Mixed effect models and rarefaction analyzes showed that large and small host trees had the same proportion of trees colonized, the same number of thalli, and the same species richness for the same area of aspen bark. This indicates that larger aspens do not have qualities, beyond size, that make them more suitable for Lobarion lichens than smaller sized aspen trees. None of the species, not even the red-listed, showed any tendencies of being dependent on larger aspens, and our results therefore did not support a strategy of retaining only large and old trees for conservation of epiphytic Lobarion lichens. Additionally, young aspens have a longer expected persistence than old aspens. However, old retention trees might be important for other species groups. We therefore recommend a conservational strategy of retaining a mixed selection of small/young and large/old aspens. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. We studied the effect of habitat fragmentation on the richness, diversity, turnover, and abundance of breeding bird communities in old, boreal mixed-wood forest by creating isolated and connected forest fragments of 1, 10, 40, and 100 ha. Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls was replicated three times. We sampled the passerine community using point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting, accumulating 21 340 records representing 59 species. We detected no significant change in species richness as a result of the harvesting, except in the 1-ha connected fragments, where the number of species increased two years after isolation. This increase was accounted for by transient species, suggesting that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement corridors. Diversity (log series alpha index) was dependent on area in the isolated fragments only after cutting, having decreased in the smaller areas. Turnover rates in the isolated fragments were sig-nificantly higher than in similar connected or control areas, due to species replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated fragments immediately after cutting, but two years after fragmentation, the responses in abundance of species varied with migratory strategy. Num-bers of Neotropical migrants declined in both connected and isolated fragments, and resident species declined in isolated fragments. Most species in these groups require older forest, many favoring interior areas. Abundance of short-distance migrants, most of which are habitat generalists, did not change. Overall, although there was no decrease in species richness from our recently fragmented areas, community structure was altered; maintaining connections between fragments helped to mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fragmentation effects we documented is small compared with those observed else-where. Birds breeding in the boreal forest, where frequent small-and large-scale natural disturbances have occurred historically, may be more resilient to human-induced habitat changes, such as those caused by forest harvesting. However, these results should be in-terpreted with caution. First, they are short-term and address only broad-scale community responses based on species richness and relative abundance. Second, the study area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening any local-scale impacts of fragmentation.},

  abstract = {Information regarding the extent, timing and magnitude of forest disturbance are key inputs required for accurate estimation of the terrestrial carbon balance. Equally important for studying carbon dynamics is the ability to distinguish the cause or type of forest disturbance occurring on the landscape. Wildfire and timber harvesting are common disturbances occurring in boreal forests, with each having differing carbon consequences (i.e., biomass removed, recovery rates). Development of methods to not only map, but distinguish these types of disturbance with satellite data will depend upon an improved understanding of their distinctive spectral properties. In this study, we mapped wildfires and clearcut harvests occurring in a Landsat time series (LTS) acquired in the boreal plains of Saskatchewan, Canada. This highly accurate reference map (kappa= 0.91) depicting the year and cause of historical disturbances was used to determine the spectral and temporal properties needed to accurately classify fire and clearcut disturbances. The results showed that spectral data from the shortwave infrared (SWIR; e.g., Landsat band 5) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum was most effective at separating fires and clearcut harvests possibly due to differences in structure, shadowing, and amounts of exposed soil left behind by the two disturbance types. Although SWIR data acquired 1 year after disturbance enabled the most accurate discrimination of fires and clearcut harvests, good separation (e.g., kappa {$\geq$} 0.80) could still be achieved with Landsat band 5 and other SWIR-based indices 3 to 4 years after disturbance. Conversely, minimal disturbance responses in near infrared-based indices associated with green leaf area (e.g., NDVI) led to unreliably low classification accuracies regardless of time since disturbance. In addition to exploring the spectral and temporal manifestation of forest disturbance types, we also demonstrate how Landsat change maps which attribute cause of disturbance can be used to help elucidate the social, ecological and carbon consequences associated with wildfire and clearcut harvesting in Canadian boreal forests.

  abstract = {The Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) has been identified as a key species for monitoring the status and health of the Southern Ocean and Antarctic ecosystems. Breeding colonies of the Antarctic petrel are often found on isolated nunataks far from inhabited stations, some up to hundreds of kilometers from the shoreline. It is difficult therefore to monitor and census known colonies, and it is believed that undiscovered breeding locations remain to be found. We developed an algorithm that can detect Antarctic petrel colonies and used it to complete a continent-wide survey using Landsat-8 Operational Line Imager (OLI) imagery in Antarctica up to the southernmost extent of Landsat's orbital view at 82.68 degrees S. Our survey successfully identified 8 known Antarctic petrel colonies containing 86\% of the known population of Antarctic petrels. The survey also identified what appears to be a significant population of breeding birds in areas not known to host breeding Antarctic petrel colonies. Our survey suggests that the breeding population at Mt. Biscoe (66 degrees 13'S 51 degrees 21'E), currently reported to be in the 1000s, may actually be on the order of 400,000 breeding pairs, which would make it the largest known Antarctic petrel breeding colony in the world. The algorithm represents a first-ever attempt to apply satellite remote sensing to assess the distribution and abundance of the Antarctic petrel on a continent-wide basis. As such, we note several algorithm shortcomings and identify research topics for algorithm improvement. Even with these caveats, our algorithm for identifying Antarctic petrel colonies with Landsat imagery demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring their populations using satellite remote sensing and identifies breeding locations, including Mt. Biscoe, that should be considered high priorities for validation with directed field surveys.},

  abstract = {In Tasmania, Australia, aggregated retention (ARN(1)) is being implemented as an alternative to clearfelling in old-growth wet eucalypt forests. These forests have traditionally been regenerated using a high-intensity burn and aerial sowing, but the use of more complex harvesting designs makes conventional high-intensity burning difficult. In 2007, a new burning method ('slow burning') was developed specifically for ARN coupes. This paper compares site preparation, burning weather conditions and burning outcomes in ARN and conventional clearfell, burn and sow (CBS) coupes burnt from 2007 to 2010. ARN coupes had higher perimeter-to-area ratios than paired CBS coupes, and 8\% more of the harvested area was affected by firebreaks. Although there was less burnt seedbed and more compacted seedbed in ARN coupes compared to clearfelled coupes, mean levels of receptive seedbed were adequate and are unlikely to limit regeneration success. Burn impact on unharvested forest was greater in ARN coupes, due largely to burning in the retained aggregates. Despite this, only 11\% of aggregate area was burnt overall, and the current guidelines for aggregate size (most {$>$}1 ha) appear sufficient to keep burn impact within acceptable thresholds.

  abstract = {The foraging patterns and behaviors of predators can be discerned using GPS data. We used GPS data to investigate the temporal patterns of wolverine (Gulo gulo luscus) foraging on large prey in northern Alberta. We built a predictive model of wolverine large-prey events (beaver predation or ungulate scavenging) based on the spatial and temporal patterns of wolverine GPS data at foraging sites we visited in the field in winter. We used this model to predict large-prey events throughout our entire wolverine GPS dataset in winter and summer. We then evaluated how variables related to prey availability, seasonality, competition, and territoriality affected wolverine encounter time, residency time, and return time at predicted large-prey events. We found that wolverines encountered large prey more often in the spring when there is increased beaver and ungulate availability. The total time that wolverines spent at large-prey events was greater in winter (3.11 days [95th percentile = 2.62-3.63 days]) than summer (2.08 days [95th percentile = 1.70-2.51 days]), potentially because prey availability is limited in winter or prey is easier to capture in summer. Wolverines partitioned the total time at events into multiple visits, reducing their residency time and increasing their return time with each revisit, indicating biomass decline through time. The time between visits in winter (10.12 days [95th percentile = 7.99-12.56 days]) and summer (8.39 days [95th percentile = 7.18-9.74 days]) suggests wolverines might be patrolling their home range. We also found that wolverine residency time decreased and return time increased when there were other large-prey events available. Moreover, wolverine residency time at events increased when other wolverines were in the area. Our results suggest that large-prey events are important to the energy balance of wolverines and that wolverine foraging behavior is dynamic in response to environmental change.},

We tested select predictions of the AAH by studying the relationships between avian acoustics and forest structural parameters for a community of forest birds, including native and introduced species, on the Big Island of Hawai'i, USA. In areas of dense vegetation, where sound degrades more easily, we expect ani-mal species to reduce the frequency at which they vocalize to reduce sound distortion. Because introduced species may have had limited time to adapt to the local habitat, we also hypothesize that their vocalizations will not change with differences in vegetation. Automated sound recorders were used to obtain information on the birds' acoustic traits. Vegetation structural characteristics were calculated using a terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor, which provides highly detailed information on the structure of the vegetation, including woody and leaf density. Of the seven native species studied, only two followed the predictions of the AAH. Interestingly, these two species had the shortest vocalizations, i.e., these vocalizations have the highest chance of information loss. Likewise, for the two introduced species, we did not observe any significant correlation with LiDAR-based vegetation structure metrics. Our study indicates that the predictions of AAH only partially account for the observed acoustic patterns observed in the study system. Other factors affecting acoustic divergence may be more important than the vegetation structure for most of the studied forest birds.},

  abstract = {Land cover products derived from remotely sensed data are now widely used in forest ecology and management as environmental layers for predictive modeling of wildlife distribution and abundance and as inputs to the design of bio-monitoring programmes. In the boreal forest, there is an urgent need to quantify the effects of industrial activity on wildlife habitat (e.g., songbirds and woodland caribou), in part to meet Environment Canada's mandates under the Species at Risk Act. Remote sensing data is the most likely spatially extensive data on habitat that can potentially meet such mandates. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative efficacy of three recently developed land cover products to describe forest habitat, by systematic comparison against a common vegetation data layer at resolutions of 250m and 1km. Specifically, we evaluated the: GLC 2000 North American Land Cover (NALC) 1km, 250m MODIS 2005 Land Cover Classification (LCC05) and the 25m Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD LC 2000) products. As ground truth data, we used an extensive suite of georeferenced vegetation relev\'e data, pre-classified according to a standardized taxonomy of plant communities (Canadian National Vegetation Classification). The study provisionally corrected ground truth data for temporal changes in land cover due to fire and forest harvesting over the sampling period. Relations between the classified relev\'e data and the land cover products are reported by means of user, producer and overall accuracy of a six common class legend. Overall the MODIS 2005 LC product showed the most consistency in agreement with independent reference data. The highest accuracy for all LC products was achieved with open to closed coniferous forest that had accuracies as high as 87.24 +/-4.28\%.},

Production forests are increasingly expected to provide a range of ecosystem services in addition to wood biomass, as well as the biodiversity upon which many of these services depend. Production forests can be managed using different methods that affect the habitat provided and the biodiversity supported. Clearcutting (CC) is a widely used forest management system that has been criticised due to its negative effects on biodiversity. Alternative less intensive forest management systems have been developed with the hope of producing comparable levels of biomass with fewer negative impacts on forest biodiversity. One of these alternatives is continuous cover forestry (CCF); a management system that always maintains tree cover in an uneven-aged production forest stand. Many studies have been conducted which contrast the effects of CCF and CC on biodiversity with varying results. The aim of the review is to explore how CCF system compares to CC in terms of outcomes for terrestrial forest biodiversity.MethodsDue to the diverse vocabulary used to describe CCF, a systematic search for terms was carried out and a comprehensive search string will be used to maximise the likelihood of finding all relevant papers. We will gather, summarise and synthesise primary field studies, both peer-reviewed and grey literature, from temperate and boreal forest comparing biodiversity in CCF and CC stands. Species richness and abundance of plants, animals and fungi will be used to conduct a meta-analysis. Other biodiversity indicators and indices will be used for a narrative synthesis. As the effects of forest management depend on local conditions, we place a special emphasis on exploring the influence of various effect modifiers.},

  abstract = {The structure of ecological networks reflects the evolutionary history of their biotic components, and their dynamics are strongly driven by ecoevolutionary processes. Here, we present an appraisal of recent relevant research, in which the pervasive role of evolution within ecological networks is manifest. Although evolutionary processes are most evident at macroevolutionary scales, they are also important drivers of local network structure and dynamics. We propose components of a blueprint for further research, emphasising process-based models, experimental evolution, and phenotypic variation, across a range of distinct spatial and temporal scales. Evolutionary dimensions are required to advance our understanding of foundational properties of community assembly and to enhance our capability of predicting how networks will respond to impending changes. Linking Evolution and Ecological Networks across Multiple Levels There is growing interest in the role of evolutionary history in determining how species interact within communities [1]. At fine spatial scales, the evolution of one species is impacted directly by others through biotic natural selection and sometimes through reciprocal coevolution (see Glossary). Interacting species, however, do not persist as isolated pairs in time and space: they are embedded within ecological networks involving multiple positive and negative interactions. Such a network perspective is essential for understanding the arena within which species interact. Network structure itself feeds back to influence evolutionary outcomes [2], and ongoing trait evolution [3]. Here, we review the impact of evolution on ecological networks, taking a novel multiscale approach. We present a synthesis of previous work on the often-interlinked drivers of network structure across space (local to regional) and time (ecological to evolutionary) (Figure 1). While we appraise how an integrative and process-based approach will advance the understanding of network assembly and structure, we focus on how this has emerged from previous work through identifying current challenges and future directions. Evolutionary Patterns in Large-Scale Networks Macroevolution and Phylogeography The availability of phylogenetic trees for entire clades allows identification of large-scale phylogenetic patterns within networks [4]. Large datasets from sequencing studies are providing the taxonomic breadth required to connect networks with macroevolutionary studies of diversification [5,6]. Many networks are phylogenetically [7] and spatially struc-tured, shaped by both historical and ongoing selection [8], which may lead to topological convergence over evolutionary time (Box 1) [9,10]. For example, rapid adaptive radiations on islands produce networks of endemics rather than recurrent and recent invaders reflecting niche differentiation among close relatives, whereas sequential sympatric specia-tion on novel plant hosts can drive modularity in networks [11]. Network structure is dynamic through evolutionary time (Figure 1). In island chronosequences, older islands},

  abstract = {Disturbances are key drivers of forest ecosystem dynamics, and forests are well adapted to their natural disturbance regimes. However, as a result of climate change, disturbance frequency is expected to increase in the future in many regions. It is not yet clear how such changes might affect forest ecosystems, and which mechanisms contribute to (current and future) disturbance resilience. We studied a 6364-ha landscape in the western Cascades of Oregon, USA, to investigate how patches of remnant old-growth trees (as one important class of biological legacies) affect the resilience of forest ecosystems to disturbance. Using the spatially explicit, individual-based, forest landscape model iLand, we analyzed the effect of three different levels of remnant patches (0\%, 12\%, and 24\% of the landscape) on 500-year recovery trajectories after a large, high-severity wildfire. In addition, we evaluated how three different levels of fire frequency modulate the effects of initial legacies. We found that remnant live trees enhanced the recovery of total ecosystem carbon (TEC) stocks after disturbance, increased structural complexity of forest canopies, and facilitated the recolonization of late-seral species (LSS). Legacy effects were most persistent for indicators of species composition (still significant 500 years after disturbance), while TEC (i.e., a measure of ecosystem functioning) was least affected, with no significant differences among legacy scenarios after 236 years. Compounding disturbances were found to dampen legacy effects on all indicators, and higher initial legacy levels resulted in elevated fire severity in the second half of the study period. Overall, disturbance frequency had a stronger effect on ecosystem properties than the initial level of remnant old-growth trees. A doubling of the historically observed fire frequency to a mean fire return interval of 131 years reduced TEC by 10.5\% and lowered the presence of LSS on the landscape by 18.1\% on average, demonstrating that an increase in disturbance frequency (a potential climate change effect) may considerably alter the structure, composition, and functioning of forest landscapes. Our results indicate that live tree legacies are an important component of disturbance resilience, underlining the potential of retention forestry to address challenges in ecosystem management.},

Information about habitat suitability allows both the inference of specific habitat management measures as well as population size estimates which can facilitate the setting up of conservation priorities. As one of the least known Palaearctic breeding birds, the current knowledge of Baillon's Crake Zapornia pusilla comprises only very general information about the species' ecological requirements, habitat selection, extent and dynamics of home ranges or population densities within its Palaearctic-Afrotropical range. We used a multi-scale approach to assess the species' habitat requirements in the Senegal River Delta, north-west Senegal. At the individual level, we calculated Manly selection indices for 17 radio-tracked Baillon's Crakes, allowing for different levels of resource availability. Considering the entire Djoudj area including the Parc National des Oiseaux du Djoudj (PNOD), we modelled presence probability as well as population density of Baillon's Crakes based on high-resolution satellite images and capture data from field surveys in 2009-2013. Using 95\% kernels, home range size was on average 1.77 +/- 0.86 ha with significant differences between habitats. Both at the individual as well as population level, Baillon's Crakes preferred edge structures, selecting for trampling paths and edges along open water bodies as well as boundaries of specific vegetation stands while species composition was of less importance. Based on the regression models, we identified 9,516 ha of suitable habitat within the Djoudj area and a potential population size of 10,714 individuals (range 3,146-17,408). Although global population estimates are highly tentative, we assume the Senegal River Delta and the PNOD of outstanding significance for African and possibly also European populations of Baillon's Crake.},

The forest ecosystems of Central Europe have recently been affected by unprecedented levels of natural disturbance, yet our understanding of their ability to recover from disturbances is still limited. Objectives: We here integrated satellite and airborne Lidar data to (i) quantify multi-decadal post-disturbance recovery of two indicators of forest structure, and (ii) compare the recovery trajectories of forest structure among managed and un-managed forests. Methods: We developed satellite-based models predicting Lidar-derived estimates of tree cover and stand height at 30~m grain across a 3100~km2 landscape in the Bohemian Forest Ecosystem (Central Europe). We summarized the percentage of disturbed area that recovered to {$>$} 40\% tree cover and {$>$} 5~m stand height and quantified the variability in both indicators over a 30-year period. The analyses were stratified by three management regimes (managed, protected, strictly protected) and two forest types (beech-dominated, spruce-dominated). Results: We found that on average 84\% of the disturbed area met our recovery threshold 30~years post-disturbance. The rate of recovery was slower in un-managed compared to managed forests. Variability in tree cover was more persistent over time in un-managed forests, while managed forests strongly converged after a few decades post-disturbance. Conclusion: We conclude that current management facilitates the recovery of forest structure in Central European forest ecosystems. However, our results underline that forests recovered well from disturbances also in the absence of human intervention. Our analysis highlights the high resilience of Central European forest ecosystems to recent disturbances.},

  abstract = {Forest biomass is one of the renewable and sustainable sources of energy that can be used for producing electricity, heat, and biofuels. The complex supply chain of forest biomass for energy generation, which consists of different players and products and is affected by biomass characteristics, such as low density and unpredictable quality, makes the energy generation cost from biomass higher than that of the conventional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. Moreover, variability and uncertainty in this supply chain, mainly due to the nature of material, economic condition and market fluctuation, affect the amount of produced energy and its cost. Mathematical modeling, in particular optimization techniques, can be employed to manage the supply chain and achieve the optimum design. This paper reviews studies which used deterministic and stochastic mathematical models to optimize forest biomass supply chains for electricity, heat and biofuels production. Optimization models were used to provide the optimum solution for decisions related to the network design, technology choice, plant size and location, storage location, mix of products and raw materials, logistics options, supply areas, and material flows. Mainly, economic objectives were considered in these models. Further studies should consider environmental and social objectives, in addition to the economic ones, in the models. In non-deterministic models uncertainty mainly in the demand, supply, prices, and conversion yields were incorporated. Although material quality is an important uncertain parameter in the forest biomass supply chain that affects the amount and cost of produced energy, its variation was not considered in previous studies. \textcopyright{} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Structural complexity is widely recognized as an inherent characteristic of unmanaged forests critical to their function and resilience, but often reduced in their managed counterparts. Variable retention harvesting (VRH) has been proposed as a way to restore or enhance structural complexity in managed forests, and thereby sustain attendant biodiversity and ecosystem function. Here we examined the decade-long response of diurnal breeding birds to a VRH experiment that, for the first time, incorporated both overstory and shrub layer treatments in red pine (Pines resinosa) dominated forests in Minnesota, USA. Overstory treatments included dispersed retention, aggregated retention achieved by cutting small (0.1 ha) gaps, aggregated retention achieved by cutting large (0.3 ha) gaps, and an uncut control. A shrub layer treatment of ambient or reduced shrub density was also implemented as a split-plot design in each harvest treatment. We found a consistent increase in bird species richness and abundance with all retention harvest treatments over time compared to the control; species richness was also significantly greater in the large gap-aggregated treatment compared to dispersed and small gap-aggregated retention harvests. Among guilds, foliage-gleaning and shrub- and tree-nesting birds exhibited the strongest positive response to retention harvesting. Species associated with early-successional habitat, forest edges, and shrubs responded most positively to VRH including Chestnut-sided Warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica) and American Restart (S. ruticilla), although late-successional species such as Blackburnian Warbler (S. fusca) and Black-throated Green Warbler (S. Wrens) also showed positive response. We found few differences due to shrub reduction, and only at the species level: Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and American Redstart were more abundant in the ambient shrub treatment, whereas Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Veery (Catharus fuscenscens), and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) were more abundant with a reduced density of shrubs. Results through the first 10 years following harvest revealed differences in bird response to both VRH and shrub treatment, suggesting that management can result in forested landscapes with bird communities that are species rich, diverse, and abundant.},

Our goal is to examine the effect of the images' acquisi-tion date and spatial resolution on the models' performance. We also seek to assess whether unclassified images provide results comparable with classified data (i.e. land-cover map). To do that we constructed species richness models (generalized additive models) based on a sample of 573 counting points and on non-classified images made up of NDVI data and digital height model (DHM), making it possible to quantify the spatial and vertical heterogeneity of habitats. To assess the acquisition date effect, we com-pared the performance of NDVI data acquired on four different dates (February 4th, June 24th, August 19th and October 18th, 2009) by the same sensor (SPOT-5). To assess the spatial resolution effect, we compared five NDVI images acquired over an identical period (September 2010) but by different sensors (WorldView-2, SPOT-5, SPOT-4, Landsat, MODIS) as well as two DHMs obtained from LiDAR (1 m) and radar (5 m) data. Our results show that for a constant spatial resolution (10 m) it is the NDVI data acquired at the beginning of the autumn that provide the best performance. These data better reveal the landscape requirements of birds during the breeding period. For a given period (September 2010), the higher reso-lution spatial data (2 m) are the highest performing. However, in view of the cost of WorldView images, we suggest that 10 m data (SPOT-5) provide a good trade-off for studying the distribution of bird com-munities. For the height data (DHM), the effect of the spatial resolution is not significant. The differences of performance between the spatial resolutions of NDVI data are not as great as those between the data acquisition periods. The performance of unclassified data (NDVI or DHM) is also comparable with that of land-cover maps. This suggests on the one hand that the choice of the NDVI image date is more important than that of the spatial resolution and on the other hand that the NDVI or DHM data are good alternatives to classified data when constructing a bird-habitat predictive model.},

  abstract = {Aim Assessing the influence of land cover in species distribution modelling is limited by the availability of fine-resolution land-cover data appropriate for most species responses. Remote-sensing technology offers great potential for predicting species distributions at large scales, but the cost and required exper-tise are prohibitive for many applications. We test the usefulness of freely avail-able raw remote-sensing reflectance data in predicting species distributions of 40 commonly occurring bird species in western Oregon. Location Central Coast Range, Cascade and Klamath Mountains Oregon, USA. Methods Information on bird observations was collected from 4598 fixed-radius point counts. Reflectance data were obtained using 30-m resolution Landsat imagery summarized at scales of 150, 500, 1000 and 2000 m. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to analyse relationships between distribu-tions of birds and reflectance values and evaluated prediction performance of the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Results Prediction success of models using all reflectance values was high (mean AUC = 0.79 AE 0.10 SD). Further, model performance using individual reflectance bands exceeded those that used only Normalized Difference Vegeta-tion Index (NDVI). The relative influence of band 4 predictors was highest, indicating the importance of variables associated with vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity. Across spatial scales, the average influence of predictors at the 2000 m scale was greatest. Main Conclusions We demonstrate that unclassified remote-sensing imagery can be used to produce species distribution models with high prediction success. Our study is the first to identify general patterns in the usefulness of spectral reflectances for species distribution modelling of multiple species. We conclude that raw Landsat Thematic Mapper data will be particularly useful in species distribution models when high-resolution predictions are required, including habitat change detection studies, identification of fine-scale biodiversity hotspots and reserve design.},

  abstract = {Stochasticity is a core component of ecology, as it underlies key processes that structure and create variability in nature. Despite its fundamental importance in ecological systems, the concept is often treated as synonymous with unpredictability in community ecology, and studies tend to focus on single forms of stochasticity rather than taking a more holistic view. This has led to multiple narratives for how stochasticity mediates community dynamics. Here, we present a framework that describes how different forms of stochasticity (notably demographic and environmental stochasticity) combine to provide underlying and predictable structure in diverse communities. This framework builds on the deep ecological understanding of stochastic processes acting at individual and population levels and in modules of a few interacting species. We support our framework with a mathematical model that we use to synthesize key literature, demonstrating that stochasticity is more than simple uncertainty. Rather, stochasticity has profound and predictable effects on community dynamics that are critical for understanding how diversity is maintained. We propose next steps that ecologists might use to explore the role of stochasticity for structuring communities in theoretical and empirical systems, and thereby enhance our understanding of community dynamics.},

Disturbance associated with the energy sector has been increasing in the boreal forest of northern Alberta.

It is important to assess population consequences of disturbance on small mammals because they serve as prey, predators, and seed\textendash spore dispersers in the terrestrial ecosystems that they inhabit. To test the effects of disturbance from the energy sector on the abundance and activity of small mammals, we used mark\textendash recapture methods and live-trapped in forested areas with one side adjacent to a clearing with industrial infrastructure present (road or compressor station) or absent (control sites). We found no difference in abundance or activity of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845)) and southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi (Vigors, 1830)) between sites and did not detect an edge effect on abundance within sites, regardless of the presence of industrial infrastructure.

We quantified changes in bat activity levels in relation to oak forest regeneration treatments consisting of harvesting at 50\% and 70\% retention levels and prescribed fire in two upland Appalachian hardwood forests in Ohio. We monitored bat activity immediately post-harvest, three growing seasons post-harvest, and after application of prescribed fire to harvested stands before the fourth growing season. Total bat activity levels were higher in thinned and thinned and burned treatments than in unthinned controls in all years, but did not differ between harvest treatment levels immediately post-harvest, three growing seasons post-harvest, or between harvest treatment levels within years. Total bat activity post-prescribed fire changed only in the 50\% retention harvest treatment blocks, wherein activity decreased. Activity levels of big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) bats were greater in harvested treatment blocks than controls in all years. Activity levels of eastern red (Lasiurus borealis), and Allyotis spp. and tri-colored (Perimyotis subflavus) collectively did not differ among treatment blocks post-fire, but were greater in harvested treatment blocks than controls three growing seasons post-harvest. Community composition was strongly related to vegetation volume, with eastern red bats and Myotis and tri-colored bats displaying positive relationships with clutter in low height strata, and big brown bats displaying a negative relationship with clutter in all height strata. The positive relationship between eastern red and Myotis and tri-colored bats and clutter in low height strata may explain why activity levels of these species decreased post-prescribed fire. Our study suggests that the harvesting component of oak forest regeneration treatments may benefit bats for several years, and that while bat activity levels may decline post-prescribed fire, overall activity levels are nonetheless greater than in unthinned areas.

  abstract = {The sub-Antarctic biome of South America is the world's southernmost forested ecosystem and one of the last remaining wilderness areas on the planet. Nonetheless, the region confronts various anthropogenic environmental impacts, such as the invasive North American beaver (Castor canadensis) and timber harvesting, particularly in stands of Nothofagus pumilio. Both of these disturbances can affect terrestrial and aquatic systems. To understand the influence and relative importance of these disturbances on sub-Antarctic watersheds, we characterized in-stream and riparian habitat conditions (pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, stream size, distance to riparian forest, bank slope, substrate heterogeneity, benthic organic matter) and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure (density, richness, diversity, evenness) and function (biomass, functional feeding group percent) in 19 streams on Tierra del Fuego Island. To explain the effects of beaver invasion and timber harvesting, we compared these physical and biotic variables among four habitat types: (a) beaver meadows, (b) shelterwood cut harvested areas without forested riparian zones, (c) variable retention harvested areas with riparian buffers, and (d) unmanaged old-growth primary forests. Most habitat variables were similar at all sites, except for dissolved oxygen (significantly higher in streams from old-growth primary forests). Benthic communities in beaver meadows had significantly lower diversity, compared to streams of unmanaged old-growth primary forests, and managed sites presented intermediate values between the two. Functionally, the benthic community in beaver meadows displayed a reduction of all functional feeding groups except collector-gatherers; again variable retention harvested areas with riparian buffers were similar to unmanaged old-growth primary forest streams, while shelterwood cut harvested areas occupied an intermediate position. These results indicated that current forestry practices that include both variable retention and legally mandated riparian forested buffers may be effective in mitigating impacts on stream benthic communities. Finally, these data demonstrated that C. canadensis invasion was a relatively larger impact on these streams than well-managed forestry practices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Objectives Our objectives were to evaluate the biodiversity values and trends in a montado system in the Alentejo, Portugal so as to inform landscape level conservation approaches. In doing so, we aimed to develop a replicable and robust approach drawing together field observation, expert opinion, and remote sensing to produce predictions relevant to land management planning. Methods Field sampling and subsequent analysis of data on the birds, butterflies and plants in eight distinct land covers allowed the identification of two principal habitat groupings of importance: `montado mosaic' and `shrubland'. Morphological spatial pattern analysis was performed on Landsat-derived GIS habitat layers for 1984 and 2009, generating maps and statistics for change in the different landscape functional classes. In addition, we demonstrated how the modelling of ecotones between open and closed biomes can identify the preferred hunting grounds of the threatened Iberian lynx and black vulture, flagship species whose conservation provides benefits to the area's wider biodiversity values. Results Total and core area of montado mosaics and shrubland increased over the 25 year period, whilst the amount of habitat connectivity declined in the case of shrubland. Considerable local variation in these trends highlighted targetable areas for conservation action (e.g. through agri-environment spending). Conclusions A rapid and robust approach was demonstrated, with potentially wider utility for biodiversity assessment and planning.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, it has been observed that most forest fires in Europe were caused by people. Extreme droughts, which are more often prolonged, can increase the risk of forest fires, not only in southern Europe but also, in Central Europe. Nonetheless, catastrophic fire events are not well recognized in the Central European Lowlands (CEL), where large forest complexes are located. Knowledge of past fire activity in this part of Europe is scarce, although several fires have occurred in this area during the previous millennia. Large coniferous forest monocultures located in the CEL are highly susceptible to fires and other disturbances. Here, we present a case study from the Tuchola Pinewoods (TP; northern Poland), where large pine monocultures are present. The main aim of this study is to document the potential effects past land management has on modern day disturbance regimes using state-of-the-art paleoecological data, historical documents and cartographic materials. We then present a protocol that will help forest managers utilize long-term paleoecological records. Based on paleoecological investigations, historical documents, and cartographic materials, our results show that, in the past 300 years, the TP witnessed not only disastrous fires and but also windfalls by tornados and insect outbreaks. A change in management from Polish to Prussian/German in the 18th century led to the transformation of mixed forests into Scots pine monocultures with the purpose to allow better economic use of the forest. Those administrative decisions led to an ecosystem highly susceptible to disturbances. This article provides a critical review of past forest management as well as future research directions related to the impacts of fire risk on land management and ecosystem services: (a) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity); (b) natural water management; and (c) mitigation of climate changes. Designated forest conditions, management, and future fire risk are a controversial and highly debated topic of forest management by Forestry Units. More research will allow the gathering of reliable information pertinent to management practices with regard to the current fire risks. It is necessary to develop a dialog between scientists and managers to reduce the risk of fires in projected climate change.},

  abstract = {Fire is an important disturbance process historically present across the northern Great Plains. Previous research from northern dry mixed-grass prairie suggests that C4 (warm season) grasses replace C3 (cool season) climax species with increasing fire, particularly in the spring. This hypothesis was tested at a landscape scale at Canadian Forces Base Suffield Alberta, by exploring the relationship between ecosystem states (C3 dominant, C3/C4 codominant, C4 dominant) inferred from a MODIS multitemporal plant functional type classification (pseudo R2: 0.598, overall accuracy: 0.74) and interyear fire history digitized from the Landsat archive (1972-2007). Probit regression showed that succession processes were different between range sites, where C4-dominant pixels were positively related to fire (P{$<$}0.001, pseudo R2=1) and completely replaced C3-dominant pixels on loamy range sites after 14 fires in 36 yr. In contrast, C3- and C3/C4-codominant pixels were related with fire on Blowouts range sites (P{$<$}0.001, pseudo R2=1), where C3/C4-codominant pixels replaced C3-dominant pixels with increasing fire. Finally, there were no statistically significant relationships between ecosystem states and fire for Sands range sites. Analysis of recovery showed that after loamy pixels experienced three to six fires in 18 yr followed by 18 yr of rest, C3-dominant pixels were reduced by over 30\% compared to unburned pixels. Finally, intrayear fire timing (2001-2009) was explored with the use of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between the spatial extent of spring and summer fires, with the use of MODIS burned-Area data. Results indicate that fires are not limited to the spring season (P{$<$}0.05), but occur across the entire growing season. Although fire timing does not appear to play a role in driving succession, this ecosystem is generally sensitive to repeated fire, with recovery of C3 climax species taking decades.},

  abstract = {1. Variable retention harvest is an increasingly popular management alternative to clear-cutting in boreal forest ecosystems. This harvest system retains a portion of the mature trees to maintain structural elements of the forest and preserve biodiversity. Residual trees must, however, survive in the post-harvest environment to realize these benefits. Here, we investigate which tree and stand characteristics are associated with high survival to aid foresters in designing harvesting prescriptions. 2. We conducted an operational-scale experiment broadly representative of western North American boreal forests. Treatments were four overstorey compositions (ranging from deciduous to conifer dominated) and five rates of canopy retention (10\%, 20\%, 50\%, 75\% and a 100\% control). Factors affecting mortality were analysed for the leading tree species (aspen Populus tremuloides Michx. and white spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss 5 and 10 years after harvest. 3. Mortality of residual aspen was highest in 10\% and 20\% retention treatments with c. 30\% mortality after 5 years and c. 50\% after 10 years. At year 5, most of the dead trees remained upright as snags (87\%), but by year 10, c. 40\% of dead trees had fallen. By contrast, mortality was much lower in the 50\% and 75\% retention treatments, and similar to that of the unharvested control. Results for white spruce mortality were similar, except the shallow-rooted spruce that was more susceptible to be blown down. 4. Regression tree analysis was used to identify individual tree attributes that predict 5-and 10-year survival. Mortality was higher for trees with a low percentage of live crown and high height/diameter ratio, when trees were very tall or were close to machine corridors. Smaller residual spruce trees fromdeciduous-dominated stands had the lowest mortality rates. 5. Synthesis and application. Where live trees are critical elements of wildlife habitat, forest managers should maintain {$>$}= 50\% in retention harvest systems. At lower levels of retention ({$<$}= 20\%), mortality can be reduced if foresters select retention trees that are stout, possess large live crowns and are small to intermediate in size. These factors can be used to help design partial harvest systems for effective biodiversity conservation strategies.},

This study assesses the assumption that VR maintains mature forests conditions after harvesting by synthesizing 605 individual results from long-term studies in two regions of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina) with permanent monitoring. VR effects on (i) forest structure, (ii) microenvironment, (iii) biodiversity, and (iv) forest reproduction, were investigated. Aggregated retention had no effect on forest structure and microenvironmental variables, but increased biodiversity variables and forest reproduction compared to unmanaged primary forest (control). Dispersed retention negatively affected the forest structure, increased biodiversity, but did not affect microclimate and forest reproduction when compared to primary forest. Thus, the ecological conditions of N. pumilio forests are influenced by variable retention harvesting, but direction and magnitude of the effect depend on the treatment and differ among groups of variable. Inside aggregates several primary forest components and conditions were maintained.},

  abstract = {Effects of forest harvesting on biodiversity can be varied and complex to understand. We provide a meta analysis of 553 studies plants, insects and birds to identify the general responses to Variable Retention harvesting (VR) 1-8 years post-harvest in Nothofagus pumilio forests of southern Patagonia. The analysis is focused on: (i) richness and abundance, (ii) origin and habitat (native forest specialist species, native species of other habitats, alien species), and (iii) temporal trends after harvesting. Our objective was to evaluate why biodiversity increases after variable retention harvesting, by assessing the effects on (i) species richness and abundance in general, (ii) native forest specialists, native generalist species and alien species, and (iii) the recovery of biodiversity toward original conditions. Forests managed with VR supported higher overall richness and abundance of plants, insects and birds in aggregate and dispersed retention than unmanaged stands, but with similar values each other. However, origin and habitat of species affected responses to VR. Aggregates support higher native forest specialist plant and lower plants of habitats other than dispersed retention. However, both retention treatments increased alien plants, although its richness and abundance was higher in dispersed retention. Native forest specialist insects were reduced in comparison to unmanaged forest, while insects of other habitats showed a positive response to both aggregate and dispersed retention as well as did for bird species richness and abundance compared to unmanaged forests. We found evidence for recovery of original conditions for native forest specialist plants and insects, and plants of other habitats. In contrast, alien plants and native insects of other habitats increased continuously in the studies included through those representing 8 years post-harvest. Major differences among both retention patterns included significantly higher richness and abundance of alien plants and native insects of other habitats in dispersed retention. Our synthesis shows recovery toward original conditions for some taxa, but demonstrates long-term establishment of alien plants as well as insect species not associated with native N. pumilio forests. These have emerged as a main potential threat to conservation of forests under VR prescription, at least at the stand level. Retention forestry could play a fundamental role for conservation in productive temperate forests, but the influence of retention pattern and aggregate size are still unclear. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These characteristics are important to ensure that the products and tools generated from our monitoring program can support management at large spatial scales in the complex socio-ecological system of Alberta.},

We reformulated removal models of avian singing rates and distance sampling models of the effective detection radius (EDR) to control for the effects of survey protocol and temporal and environmental covariates on detection probabilities. We estimated singing rates and EDR for 75 boreal forest songbird species and found that survey protocol, especially point-count radius, explained most of the variation in detectability. However, environmental and temporal covariates (date, time, vegetation) affected singing rates and EDR for 73\% and 59\% of species, respectively. Unadjusted survey counts increased by an average of 201\% from a 5-min, 50-m radius survey to a 10-min, 100-m radius survey (n = 75 species). This variability was decreased to 8{$\cdot$}5\% using detection probabilities estimated from a combination of removal and distance sampling models.

  abstract = {Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) populations residing in interior ecosystems of North America are known to frequent harvested areas and areas burnt by wildfires, as both disturbances encourage growth of early seral vegetation preferred by them. This is especially evident in places where there is a paucity of large natural openings and areas with a long history of wildfire suppression, such as the foothill forests of west-central Alberta. Little has been done, however, to directly quantify and compare grizzly bear food-supply in both disturbance types and at early stages of forest regeneration. In this paper, we explore whether harvested areas can act as surrogates to wildfires for grizzly bear food-supply in west-central Alberta, Canada. We sampled known fruit-bearing and herbaceous grizzly bear foods for their occurrence, productivity, and digestible energy supply among post-harvest, post-fire, and mature forests disturbance types, and across very young (\textasciitilde 5 yrs), young (\textasciitilde 20 yrs), and mid (\textasciitilde 60 yrs) age-classes for post-harvest and post-fire disturbances. A variety of foods occurred at greater frequency in post-harvest stands, with the occurrence of most foods explained by the main effects of disturbance and age-class, or in combination with one environmental covariate. Overall, fruit productivity and digestible energy from fruits were highest in the young age-class, whereas forb productivity and digestible energy from forbs were highest in the very young age-class. There were no significant differences in total available digestible energy (fruit + forb) between post-harvest and post-fire stands within any age-class, but significant differences were evident between age-classes. These results suggest that harvested areas can potentially act as a surrogate to wildfires in relation to grizzly bear food-supply, but human access remains a key challenge for harvests given their association with roads. We suggest that harvested areas could be used as management tool to maintain or enhance grizzly bear food-supply and thus contribute to population recovery efforts, especially in areas of wildfire suppression.},

Japan provides a unique opportunity to test for regional modification of landscape effects due to its broad temperature gradient, coincident with a gradient of historical disturbance intensity. Objectives: To quantify and understand how regional contexts modify forest bird community responses to landscape heterogeneity across Japan. Methods: We characterised the functional trait composition and diversity of breeding bird communities from 297 forest sites, and applied a cross-scale analytical framework to explain regional variation in community responses. Results: The effects of landscape diversity, coincident with forest loss, varied in strength and even direction across the temperature gradient. Cool regions of Japan with highly forested, homogeneous landscapes supported bird communities dominated by forest specialists: those with narrow habitat breadths and~insectivorous diets. Warmer regions comprised communities dominated by generalists with wider habitat breadths, even in contiguous, highly forested landscapes. Heterogeneous landscapes selected for generalists, and only promoted functional trait diversity in cool regions where both specialists and generalists can be supplied by a diverse regional pool. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that regional variation in trait responses to landscape heterogeneity\textemdash driven by past environmental filtering and broad-scale climates\textemdash leads to differential community responses across Japan. Future research that seeks a nuanced understanding of the regional modification of landscape variables will better serve to inform and target real-world conservation efforts.},

The basic rationale of the project, i. e., to fill significant information needs of modem industrial forestry through multi-disciplinary, collaborative research, was developed through a series of meetings and field excursions aimed at development of an experiment to improve understanding of the responses of a northern mixedwood forest to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. We worked to assure high probable levels of academic and intellectual payoff and excellent opportunities for graduate students. The overall objectives of the EMEND project include ecological, economic and social elements and their integration in the context of forest management appropriate specifically for the northern mixed-wood ecosystem of Northwestern Alberta.

  abstract = {The EMEND project was established over the two year period of 1997-1999. EMEND research falls into two main categories: 1) collection and analysis of experimentwide data, mainly by a centrally-administered "Core Crew", and 2) research planned and executed by researchers interested in using a more restricted part of the EMEND experiment as a template for their work. This report deals with work done under category 1 and category 2 activities of the Core Crew that enable graduate student projects (the majority of the SFMN funding). During the summer of 1997 a 5-person, SFMNsupported (\$60 K) Core Crew, under the supervision of an industrially funded Project Coordinator, conducted detailed forest surveys through location and measurement of 450 pre-selected plots. This work supported the selection of stands (c. 250 ha) to be used in the experiment representing each of four cover-types characteristic of the northern mixedwood forest. The experiment was laid out on the ground during the winter of 1997- 98 to prepare the site for pre-treatment work in summer 1998. The 1997 data suggested that most stands in NW Alberta move along one of two basic successional pathways after their establishment: i) a slow progression from aspen dominated stands, through mixed stands to conifer dominated stands, or ii) a faster progression from aspen stands with concomitantly established spruce understorey to conifer dominated stands. During the summer of 1998 a 7-person, SFMN-assisted (\$15K) field team, again under an industrially funded Project Coordinator, collected experiment-wide pre-treatment data through establishment and measurement of 600 permanent sample plots (6 plots in each of the 10- ha experimental compartments). Analysis of these data reveal no inadvertent biases in treatment allocation with respect to basic mensurational characteristics of the stands. Some significant variation in stand density has been effectively dealt with by blocking in the design. Thus, a strong inferential basis for EMEND is assured. Analysis of variation across cover-types suggests that aspen-dominated stands in the area have not yet reached the self-thinning equilibrium.},

  abstract = {Community structure and relative abundance of 27 species of small mammals and forest birds were compared among three types of residual forest stands and unharvested control forest (CO). Treatments were young and old mosaics (a checkerboard pattern of residual and logged forest units of 85\textendash 100 ha each) and megablocks (residual stands of 250\textendash{} 300 ha isolated within a logged area of 2500\textendash 3000 ha). Relative abundances were also used to establish habitat use models (HUMs). We found no statistical difference in species relative abundances between treatments and COs, although small sample sizes limited statistical power. HUMs explained a large amount of variation in habitat use for 15 mammal and bird species (mean 57.4 {$\pm$} 3.5\%, ranging between 22.3\% and 75.7\%). Variance partitioning emphasized the importance of stand structure characteristics as the principal predictors of abundance for censused species. Our results suggested that mosaics and megablocks are both suitable configurations to maintain studied species because no species exhibited lower relative abundances in such residual forest stands than COs. We suggest that residual forest stands planning should shift from a strictly landscape perspective toward a more holistic approach that considers residual forest structure as well as landscape characteristics.

  abstract = {Habitat fragmentation can have a range of negative demographic and genetic impacts on disturbed populations. Dispersal barriers can be created, reducing gene flow and increasing population differentiation and inbreeding in isolated habitat remnants. Aggregated retention is a form of forestry that retains patches of forests as isolated island or connected edge patches, with the aim of lifeboating' species and processes, retaining structural features and improving connectivity. Swamp rats (Rattus lutreolus) are a cover-dependent species that are sensitive to habitat removal. We examined the effects of aggregated retention forestry and forestry roads in native wet Eucalyptus forests on swamp rat gene flow and population genetic structure. We characterized neighbourhood size in unlogged forest to provide a natural state for comparison, and examined population structure at a range of spatial scales, which provided context for our findings. Tests of pairwise relatedness indicated significant differentiation between island and edge populations in aggregated retention sites, and across roads in unlogged sites. Spatial autocorrelation suggested a neighbourhood size of 42-55m and revealed male-biased dispersal. We found no genetic isolation by geographical distance at larger ({$>$}2.3km) scales and populations were all significantly differentiated. Our results suggest that removal of mature forest creates barriers for swamp rat dispersal. In particular, roads may have long-term impacts, while harvesting of native forests is likely to create only short-term dispersal barriers at the local scale, depending on the rate of regeneration.},

  abstract = {Aggregated retention (a type of variable retention) is a silvicultural practice that is being implemented in forests worldwide as an alternative to traditional clearfelling (clearcutting) practices. Aggregated retention retains patches of unlogged forest within the harvested matrix. It has been proposed that it retains biodiversity values better than clearfelling, although, to date, there has been limited research on small mammal responses to this practice, especially in southern hemisphere systems. This study determined whether aggregated retention provided a ``lifeboat\{''\} for two native rodent species; the habitat specialist, cover-dependent swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus velutinus), and the habitat generalist, long-tailed mouse (Pseudomys higginsi), in wet Eucalyptus forests. We compared their abundances in three forestry treatments (clearfell, burn and sow, unlogged native forest and aggregated retention (including edges, islands and harvested matrix)) over three trapping periods (one- to three-years post-burn), and assessed the effect of habitat cover (vegetation) on rodent abundances. The cover-dependent swamp rat was found in highest abundance in unlogged forest, intermediate in aggregated retention and lowest in clearfelling. Within aggregated retention, there was a trend for decreasing swamp rat abundance with increasing disturbance within the different habitat types (highest abundance in edges, intermediate in islands, lowest in harvested matrix). The generalist long-tailed mouse, was found in equal abundance across all forestry treatments and habitat types. Island size within aggregated retention coupes had no effect on the presence of either species. Sex ratios did not differ between forestry treatments or habitat types for either species, although swamp rats showed female dominance irrespective of treatment or habitat type. Within harvested areas, a high percentage understorey cover was an important predictor of swamp rat abundance. Our results demonstrate that aggregated retention provides a lifeboat for cover-dependent small mammals in comparison to traditional clearfelling practices. The habitat cover provided by the retained forest allows populations to persist in connected and isolated patches within production landscapes. Vegetation density at the lower strata appears to be an important determinant for recolonisation in harvested areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We evaluated an underexplored dimen-sion of the mismatch between climate and biota: limitations to forest growth and succession affecting habitat suitability. Our objective was to inform conti-nental-scale conservation for boreal songbirds under disequilibria between climate, vegetation and fauna. Location Boreal and southern arctic ecoregions of North America. Methods We used forest inventory and avian survey data to classify 53 species by seral-stage affinity and applied these to generate alternative projections of changes in species' core habitat distributions based on different vegetation lag-time assumptions. We used our seral stage-modified refugia approach and the Zonation algorithm to identify multispecies boreal conservation priorities over the 21st century. We evaluated the sensitivity of land rankings to seral-stage affinity and species' weights and assessed the conservation value of the existing protected areas network compared to Zonation results. Results End-of-century projected changes in songbird distribution were reduced by up to 169\% when vegetation lags were considered. Zonation land rankings based on unconstrained climate projections were concentrated at high latitudes, whereas those based on strict and modified refugia scenarios were concentrated in coastal and high-elevation areas, as well as biome transition zones, which were fairly consistent over time and species weights. The existing protected areas network covering 14\% of the study area was estimated to con-serve 12\textendash 14\% of baseline avian biodiversity across time periods and scenarios, compared to 16\textendash 25\% for top-ranked Zonation areas. Main conclusions For some boreal songbirds, limits to forest growth and succes-sion may result in dramatic reductions in suitable habitat over the next century. Our seral stage-adjusted approach provides conservative and efficient boreal con-servation priorities anchored around climatic macrorefugia that are robust to cen-tury-long climate change and complement the current protected areas network.},

We surveyed songbirds in 166 stands in the Rocky Mountains in BC, Canada, that had been logged or burned by wildfire. Stands were located in mid or high elevation biogeoclimatic zones, and varied from 7 to 45 years since disturbance and in density of residual trees from 0 to 320 conifer overstory, 0 to 832 conifer understory, and 0 to 68 broadleaf trees/ha. Although differences in bird communities between burned and logged stands of similar ages were detected, these differences were not consistent between biogeoclimatic zones, nor did they explain a large amount of the variation in bird communities. Logged stands had a higher density of birds, but expected species richness did not differ between logged and burned stands. All but a few rare species were detected in both disturbance types. Of 26 species analysed in detail, densities of 14 were greater in logged stands, 6 were greater in burned stands, and 6 were not significantly different between disturbance types. The bird community, bird abundance and densities of individual species were influenced by residual tree density and type. As time since disturbance increased, bird communities in burned and logged stands in the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir zone became more similar, but those in the Montane Spruce zone became less so, likely due to differences in residual tree density. Results suggest differences in bird communities in logged and burned stands !7 years post-disturbance are mainly in abundance rather than community composition, but abundances of individual species can be significantly influenced by residual tree density and type.

Leaving residual (live) trees in harvested areas is key to this strategy. However, the effectiveness of this approach is unknown. I surveyed songbirds in 176 stands in the Rocky Mountains of southeastern British Columbia, Canada, that had been logged or burned by wildfire. Stands varied in time-since-disturbance from 5-45 yr. and in residual tree density from 0-2 16 conifer overstory, 0-268 conifer understory, and 0-35 broadleaf trees/ha. In 28 of these stands, artificial and natural nests were used to examine nest predation. Logged and burned stands had similar dominant species, evenness, and diversity (Simpson's index) of birds, but logged stands had higher richness and abundance. Of 26 species analyzed, 20 had similar or greater abundance in logged stands; 6 had greater abundance in burned stands. Differences in songbird communities were likely related to differences in vegetation. As a result of non-intensive logging practices, logged stands had greater shrub cover, shrub richness, broadleaf tree basal area, and more vegetation layers, but fewer regenerating trees, snags, and down wood than burned stands. As time-since-disturbance increased, bird communities in the two disturbance types became more similar at higher elevations, but not at lower elevations. Residual broadleaf and conifer understory tree density positively influenced songbird richness and abundance. Abundance of individual bird species was positively and negatively associated with residual trees. There was no strong or consistent evidence that depredation of nests of ground-and shrub-nesting songbirds increased with residual tree density. Depredation of artificial nests increased with residual tree density in logged stands in one of two years, but not in burned stands. Depredation was higher for artificial than natural nests. Retaining residual trees in managed stands can enhance richness and abundance of songbirds without increasing nest predation. The lange of densities in this study provided},

We split the remote sensing images into 16 \&times; 16 patches and labeled them as positive samples if they have overlap with stopovers. Second, a multi-convolution neural network model is proposed for extracting the features from temperature data and remote sensing images, respectively. Then a Support Vector Machines (SVM) model was used to combine the features together and predict classification results eventually. The experimental analysis was carried out on public Landsat 5 TM images and a GPS dataset was collected on 29 birds over three years. The results indicated that our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods and was able to achieve good performance in habitat suitability prediction.},

Small mustelids are impacted negatively as is the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi), a principal prey species, that disappears from clearcuts within a year of harvest. These effects may be potentially ameliorated by aggregated retention harvests that leave unlogged patches on clearcuts. We tested three hypotheses (H) that (H1) abundance, reproduction, and survival of M. gapperi populations, (H2) total abundance, species richness, and diversity of the forest-floor small mammal community, and (H3) the presence of small mustelids would be greater in large than small patches of retention forest on new clearcuts. We measured demographic responses of M. gapperi, total small mammals, and the presence of small mustelids (American marten, Martes americana, and small weasels (Mustela spp.)) from 2014 to 2016 in replicated treatments of four sizes (ha) of retention patches (means of 0.53, 1.50, 4.13, and 18.73) near Elkhart in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Mean abundance, reproduction, and survival attributes of M. gapperi were similar among treatment sites over the 3-year study. Overall mean abundance ranged from 3.5 to 5.3 voles per line in patches while this microtine was extirpated on clearcut sites (i.e., no forest patches). The similarity in population dynamics among the various forest patches across a gradient of increasing patch size of 4.5 to 35.3 times did not support H1. Mean abundance, species richness, and diversity of total forest-floor small mammals were similar among treatment sites, and hence did not support H2. Although not formally significant, mean species diversity did show a consistent increase from the largest (0.82) to the smallest (1.11) patch size, owing primarily to the presence of several generalist species such as Neotamias amoenus, Microtus, and Sorex in nearby early successional habitat. Small mustelids were present at similar levels among patch sizes, presumably in response to abundance of small mammal prey, and hence did not support H3. Although our results were relatively short-term, the detailed assessment of population dynamics of M. gapperi indicated that habitat quality was sufficient to maintain this species regardless of patch sizes, ranging from 0.3 to 20.0 ha. Similarly, the total forest-floor small mammal community and presence of small mustelids also followed this pattern. All sizes of forest patches have conservation value and will help to maintain abundance and diversity of forest mammals, both predator and prey species, on clearcuts. Longer-term studies (e.g., at 5- to 10-year intervals) are essential to determine if our results are sustainable in augmenting forest restoration.},

  abstract = {Retention forestry, the practice of maintaining stand legacies in harvested forests, is used to create more complex forest structure and positive biodiversity outcomes in managed forests. However, the relative effectiveness of different retention strategies at increasing forest structural complexity and populations of dependent wildlife species is not well understood. We used an experimental study to evaluate changes in the population density of three small mammal species in response to different size and location (riparian or upland) of retention tree patches within harvested forests in the Pacific Northwest, USA. We further assessed whether small mammal density varied in relation to differences in structural complexity within retention patches among experimental retention stands. Within stands, deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) population density did not differ between retention and harvested areas ({$\beta$} = -0.05, SE = 0.06), Townsend's chipmunk (Neotamias townsendii) density was higher in retention compared to clearcut areas ({$\beta$} = 1.61, SE = 0.10), and creeping vole (Microtus oregoni) density was highest in clearcut areas ({$\beta$} = -0.68, SE = 0.10). At the stand-scale, deer mouse density and chipmunk density were lowest in stands with large upland patches of retention (mean = 83, SD = 28 trees) and highest in stands with multiple small patches of upland retention (mean = 8, SD = 2 trees). Creeping vole density followed the opposite pattern, highest in stands with large upland patches and lowest in stands with multiple small patches. Densities of each species were intermediate in stands where at least a portion of the retention trees were connected to forested riparian buffers. Relating the density of each species to structural complexity within stands revealed that Townsend's chipmunk density increased with increasing retention tree blowdown ({$\beta$} = 0.39, SE = 0.08), a proxy for downed wood resources, whereas creeping vole density decreased ({$\beta$} = -0.51, SE = 0.12), and deer mice density did not change consistently ({$\beta$} = 0.00, SE = 0.08). Furthermore, retention tree mortality was highest in the experimental treatment with several small patches and lowest in the treatment with a single large patch. Our results demonstrate that adopting dispersed retention patch patterns increases the abundance of small mammals in managed, early-seral forests in the Pacific Northwest. This relationship is at least partly mediated through higher levels of structural complexity within small retention patches caused by increased retention tree blowdown compared to larger patches.},

This research assesses the estimation of forest structure, composition and deadwood variables from small-footprint airborne lidar data, both discrete return (DR) and full waveform (FW), acquired under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. The field site, in the New Forest, UK, includes managed plantation and ancient, semi-natural, coniferous and deciduous woodland. Point clouds were rendered from the FW data through Gaussian decomposition. An area-based regression approach (using Akaike Information Criterion analysis) was employed, separately for the DR and FW data, to model 23 field-measured forest variables. A combination of plot-level height, intensity/amplitude and echo-width variables (the latter for FW lidar only) generated from both leaf-on and leaf-off point cloud data were utilised, together with individual tree crown (ITC) metrics from rasterised leaf-on height data. Statistically significant predictive models (p b 0.05) were gener-ated for all 23 forest metrics using both the DR and FW lidar datasets, with R 2 values for the best fit models in the range R 2 = 0.43\textendash 0.94 for the DR data and R 2 = 0.28\textendash 0.97 for the FW data (with normalised RMSE values being 18\%\textendash 66\% and 16\%\textendash 48\% respectively). For all but two forest metrics the difference between the NRMSE of the best performing DR and FW models was {$\leq$}7\%, and there was an even split (11:12) as to which lidar dataset (DR or FW) generated the best model per forest metric. Overall, the DR data performed better at modelling structure var-iables, whilst the FW data performed better at modelling composition and deadwood variables. Neither showed a clear advantage at modelling variables from a particular vegetation layer (canopy, shrub or ground). Height, inten-sity/amplitude, and ITC-derived crown variables were shown to be important inputs across the best performing models (DR or FW), but the additional echo-width variables available from FW point data were relatively unimpor-tant. Of perhaps greater significance to the choice between lidar data type (i.e. DR or FW) in determining the pre-dictive power of the best performing models was the selection of leaf-on and/or leaf-off data. Of the 23 best models, 10 contained both leaf-on and leaf-off lidar variables, whilst 11 contained only leaf-on and two only leaf-off data. We therefore conclude that although FW lidar has greater vertical profile information than DR lidar, the greater complimentary information about the entire forest canopy profile that is available from both leaf-on and leaf-off data is of more benefit to forest inventory, in general, than the selection between DR or FW lidar.},

In total, 18 sites, nine of which were burned, were studied in a large-scale field experiment in eastern Finland. Polypore fungi were surveyed 10 years after the bumings. In total, we sampled 13,083 stumps and 12,023 pieces of slash and counted 6,598 polypore records of 54 species. Burned stumps hosted more polypores than unburned stumps, but burning had no effect on polypores on slash. Both stumps and slash hosted also some red-listed polypore species - more so, if the resource was burned. The results show that stumps and slash can be valuable substrates for wood-decaying fungi, including rare and red-listed species.

We present the long-term effects of these methods on polypore fungi, a taxonomic group that has been severely affected by forestry. Using a 10-year, large-scale field experiment, we studied how prescribed burning and two different tree retention levels (10 and 50m(3)ha(-1)) affect polypore fungi. We monitored polypore sporocarps on 2767 individually marked trees four times over the study period: in the first autumn after the treatments, and again 2, 4 and 10years after the treatments. The number of polypore species and records initially increased rather slowly but showed a marked increasing trend towards the end of the 10-year monitoring period. After 2years, the higher retention sites had an average 85 species and the low retention sites 45 species per site. After 4years, the difference was 14 vs. 9 species and after 10years 26 vs. 19 species. Red-listed species were not found often on the trunks earlier than 10years after the treatments. Prescribed burning increased the number of polypore species and records along with time. Furthermore, 13 species favoured burned sites, while only six species favoured unburned sites, and the differences in the composition of species assemblages between burned and unburned sites were evident 10years after the treatments.Synthesis and applications. We show, for the first time, that retention trees can host rich polypore assemblages, and even some red-listed species, and, thus, be useful in conservation of forest biodiversity outside protected areas. Higher retention levels maintain more diverse polypore assemblages. Prescribed burning increases the positive effects of retention forestry by creating substrates that are typical in the early-successional natural forests.

  abstract = {1. Fundamental ecological research is both intrinsically interesting and provides the basic knowledge required to answer applied questions of importance to the management of the natural world. The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n2. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n3. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n4. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n5. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution.\textbackslash r\textbackslash n6. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

In total, 28 nests were found during 2010 and 2011. To determine nesting site preferences, the species composition of vegetation in scrub used for nesting was compared to that of nearest unused scrub. To evaluate habitat preferences, a Resource Selection Probability Function (RSPF) was modelled based on presence/absence data. The habitat factors were represented by Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) derived measures of vegetation height and topographic wetness as well as distance to nearest road/path, as an indicator of human disturbance. Scrub used as nesting sites were characterized by thorny shrub species such as Prunus spinosa and Rubus fruticosus. RSPF showed that shrike presence was positively correlated with vegetation heterogeneity and high topographic wetness, and that it was unaffected by the distance to the nearest road/path. These results provide some guidelines for management, showing that Red-backed Shrike for nesting preferred habitats with high wetness, possibly linked to food availability, and heterogeneous vegetation, consistent with their need for low vegetation for hunting and higher vegetation for hunting perches and nest sites, with thorny shrubs especially important for the latter.},

Post-disturbance ecosystems are also often rich in biological legacies, including surviving organisms and organically derived structures, such as woody debris. These legacies and postdisturbance plant communities provide resources that attract and sustain high species diversity, including numerous early-successional obligates, such as certain woodpeckers and arthropods. Early succession is the only period when tree canopies do not dominate the forest site, and so this stage can be characterized by high productivity of plant species (including herbs and shrubs), complex food webs, large nutrient fluxes, and high structural and spatial complexity. Different disturbances contrast markedly in terms of biological legacies, and this will influence the resultant physical and biological conditions, thus affecting successional pathways. Management activities, such as post-disturbance logging and dense tree planting, can reduce the richness within and the duration of early-successional ecosystems. Where maintenance of biodiversity is an objective, the importance and value of these natural early-successional ecosystems are underappreciated. \textcopyright{} The Ecological Society of America.},

Recent advances in lidar and radar remote sensing have shown considerable potential for mapping forest structure and habitat characteristics across landscapes. However, their relative efficacies and integrated use in habitat mapping remain largely unexplored. We evaluated the use of lidar, radar and multispectral remote sensing data in predicting multi-year bird detections or prevalence for 8 migratory songbird species in the unfragmented temperate deciduous forests of New Hampshire, USA. Methodology and Principal Findings: A set of 104 predictor variables describing vegetation vertical structure and variability from lidar, phenology from multispectral data and backscatter properties from radar data were derived. We tested the accuracies of these variables in predicting prevalence using Random Forests regression models. All data sets showed more than 30\% predictive power with radar models having the lowest and multi-sensor synergy ("fusion") models having highest accuracies. Fusion explained between 54\% and 75\% variance in prevalence for all the birds considered. Stem density from discrete return lidar and phenology from multispectral data were among the best predictors. Further analysis revealed different relationships between the remote sensing metrics and bird prevalence. Spatial maps of prevalence were consistent with known habitat preferences for the bird species. Conclusion and Significance: Our results highlight the potential of integrating multiple remote sensing data sets using machine-learning methods to improve habitat mapping. Multi-dimensional habitat structure maps such as those generated from this study can significantly advance forest management and ecological research by facilitating fine-scale studies at both stand and landscape level. \textcopyright{} 2012 Swatantran et al.},

  abstract = {A major conservation concern is whether population size and other ecological variables change linearly with habitat loss, or whether they suddenly decline more rapidly below a ''critical threshold'' level of habitat. The most commonly discussed explanation for critical threshold responses to habitat loss focus on habitat configuration. As habitat loss progresses, the remaining habitat is increasingly fragmented or the fragments are increasingly isolated, which may compound the effects of habitat loss. In this review we also explore other possible explanations for apparently nonlinear relationships between habitat loss and ecological responses, including Allee effects and time lags, and point out that some ecological variables will inherently respond nonlinearly to habitat loss even in the absence of compounding factors. In the literature, both linear and nonlinear ecological responses to habitat loss are evident among simulation and empirical studies, although the presence and value of critical thresholds is influenced by characteristics of the species (e.g. dispersal, reproduction, area/edge sensitivity) and landscape (e.g. fragmentation, matrix quality, rate of change). With enough empirical support, such trends could be useful for making important predictions about species' responses to habitat loss, to guide future research on the underlying causes of critical thresholds, and to make better informed management decisions. Some have seen critical thresholds as a means of identifying conservation targets for habitat retention. We argue that in many cases this may be misguided, and that the meaning (and utility) of a critical threshold must be interpreted carefully and in relation to the response variable and management goal. Despite recent interest in critical threshold responses to habitat loss, most studies have not used any formal statistical methods to identify their presence or value. Methods that have been used include model comparisons using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or t-tests, and significance testing for changes in slope or for polynomial effects. The judicious use of statistics to help determine the shape of ecological relationships would permit greater objectivity and more comparability among studies.},

  abstract = {Habitat suitability models are based on digital maps that very often describe the environment at a human scale and, hence miss ecological structures and features that are important for wildlife. LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data, laser scanning acquired by remote sensing, can fill this gap by providing useful information not only on the spatial extent of habitat types but also information on the vertical height. The advantage of LiDAR derived variables lays also in the availability at a large scale, instead of just in the survey sites. In this work we evaluated the effect of three LiDAR derived variables (tree height, percentage of trees in open areas and length of ecotone) on the performance of habitat models, developed for four farmland bird species. For each species multiple runs of stepwise Logistic Regression (LR) and Maximum Entropy Models (Maxent) were performed. For each run we included and excluded the LiDAR variables and recorded the improvement in model performance using the AUC, AIC, Sensitivity, Specificity. Model results were applied in a GIS in order to create habitat suitability maps. Results for the RL models showed that for most of the species at least one LiDAR variable was selected and significant (p{$<$} 0.05). Additionally the inclusion LIDAR data gave a positive percentage of contribution to the AUC of the Maxent models. The models calculated using LiDAR derived variables identified a smaller area on the map, with a better overlap with open areas, thus showing a more realistic spatial pattern. The interpretation of these variable is also more straightforward, both from the ecological point of view and when defining management guidelines. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Location: World-wide. Methods: We reviewed 85 publications for the period 1960-2003. We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study. Main conclusions: The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to 'keystone structures' that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

Fungi are a megadiverse taxonomic group where lack of knowledge impedes sufficient conservation focus. Inventories of fungi require a high level of expertise and are difficult and expensive due to seasonal variation and fluctuation in sporocarp formation. Lidar offers objective, fine-resolution and potentially cheap and broad scale data for representing vegetation structure and has proven useful for prediction of the diversity of plant and animal species. In this study, we used lidar-derived variables as explanatory variables in models of fungal species richness and controlling gradients of species composition, represented by three ordination axes derived from multidimensional scaling. The fungal data comprised a data set of 1527 species recorded in three inventories of 121 sites covering all major terrestrial habitat types across Denmark. We compared the performance of lidar-derived explanatory variables with two field inventory-based sets of variables: 1) lists of vascular plants and 2) recordings of soil, microclimate and vegetation structure. Lidar-derived variables performed best in predicting fungal richness and the first ordination axis, interpreted as a gradient from low and open herb-dominated communities over closed swards and scrubs to closed-canopy forests (cross validated r2 of 0.50 and 0.81, respectively). The number of red-listed species and the second ordination axis were poorly predicted by lidar, and the third ordination axis was equally well detected by the three explanatory sets of variables (cross validated r2 of 0.38). From a fungal conservation perspective, it is promising that lidar-based variables hold information suitable for detecting major gradients in fungal richness and composition.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Despite potential negative effects on biodiversity, salvage logging is often conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded from logging and reserved for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for post-disturbance management are widely lacking. 2. A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been conducted less than 5years following natural disturbances, and focused on non-saproxylic organisms. 3. A meta-analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage logging significantly decreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic groups. Richness of dead wood dependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms) decreased more strongly than richness of non-saproxylic taxa. In contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats increased in the number of species after salvage logging. 4. By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate that salvage logging significantly alters community composition in 7 of 17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging is not consistent with the management objectives of protected areas. Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research should investigate the amount and spatio-temporal distribution of retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity.},

In recent years, multi-species occupancy models (MSOM) have been developed as a statistical tool to account for species-specific heterogeneity in detection while estimating true measures of diversity. Although the power of these models has been tested in various ways, their ability to estimate gamma diversity\textemdash or true community size, N is a largely unrecognized feature that needs rigorous evaluation. We use both simulations and an empirical dataset to evaluate the bias, precision, accuracy and coverage of estimates of N from MSOM compared to the widely applied iChao2 non-parametric estimator. We simulated 5,600 datasets across seven scenarios of varying average occupancy and detectability covariates, as well as varying numbers of sites, replicates and true community size. Additionally, we use a real dataset of surveys over 9 years (where species accumulation reached an asymptote, indicating true N), to estimate N from each annual survey. Simulations showed that both MSOM and iChao2 estimators are generally accurate (i.e. unbiased and precise) except under unideal scenarios where mean species occupancy is low. In such scenarios, MSOM frequently overestimated N. Across all scenarios, MSOM estimates were less certain than iChao2, but this led to over-confident iChao2 estimates that showed poor coverage. Results from the real dataset largely confirmed the simulation findings, with MSOM estimates showing greater accuracy and coverage than iChao2. Community ecologists have a wide choice of analytical methods, and both iChao2 and MSOM estimates of N are substantially preferable to raw species counts. The simplicity of non-parametric estimators has obvious advantages, but our results show that in many cases, MSOM may provide superior estimates that also account more accurately for uncertainty. Both methods can show strong bias when average occupancy is very low, and practitioners should show caution when using estimates derived from either method under such conditions.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, alternative management techniques integrating conservation concerns into industrial forestry have become increasingly widespread. In order to compare the effects of various management methods on forest site and biodiversity, a systematic forestry experiment was conducted in a managed, mature oak-hornbeam forest. The present work introduces the 2-year responses of environmental variables and understory vegetation to different silvicultural treatments. These belong either to clear-cutting (clear-cutting, retention tree group), to shelterwood (preparation cutting), or to continuous cover forestry systems (gap-cutting). The experiment follows a complete block design with four replicates. Light availability was significantly higher in all the treatments than in the uncut control, with highest values in the clear-cuts. Soil moisture was highest in the gap-cuts and clear-cuts, while in the retention tree group, it did not differ from the control. Species richness, cover, and height of the understory considerably differed from the control in the clear-cuts and gap-cuts, while in the retention tree group, only species richness was higher. The establishment of ruderal, non-forest species altered the species composition in the clear-cuts. Based on these short-term responses, we conclude that as a result of the extreme environmental changes, clear-cutting in oak-hornbeam forests changes the understory vegetation considerably. Retention tree groups can maintain legacies of the understory composition for some years. Despite the experienced high vegetation cover, gap-cutting preserves the forest characteristics of the understory better than clear-cutting. These results confirm that in oak-hornbeam forests, continuous cover forestry may be more sustainable from conservational aspect than clear-cutting system.},

  abstract = {Retention of residual trees in ''cutblocks,'' logged blocks of forest, has been proposed as a method to conserve songbirds in landscapes fragmented by clear-cut logging. We examined songbird communities in the boreal mixed-wood forest of Alberta, Canada, to investigate the effect on songbird abundance of (1) logging and (2) retaining variable densities of residual trees in cutblocks (10\textendash 133 trees/ha or basal area of 0.50\textendash 10.65 m 2). We surveyed songbirds in logged and forested, aspen-dominated, mixed-wood stands in the year before, the year after, and three years after logging. We analyzed changes in abundance of 27 common songbird species: 23 present in the forest prior to logging and four that appeared after logging. Ten species declined with logging and were termed ''forest species.'' Ten more species did not change with logging and were called ''habitat gener-alists.'' The seven species that increased with logging were called ''cutblock species.'' When the effect of residual tree retention was examined in terms of basal area (rather than density) of residual trees, more songbird species were found to be both positively and negatively affected by residual tree retention, despite the fact that the two tree measures were highly correlated. In the first year after logging, four bird species (two forest, one generalist, and one cutblock) increased, and none decreased with increasing residual tree retention in cutblocks. In the third year after logging, again four species increased with increasing retention, but these were different species than in the first year after logging (one forest and three generalist species). Furthermore, four cutblock species decreased with increasing retention. Based on these findings, we conclude that retention of residual trees may be beneficial to some species, although conservation of unlogged reserves is also important. Most importantly, we recommend that research be continued to examine a larger range of tree retention and longer term effects on the avifauna.},

  abstract = {Identifying the factors that infl uence geographic range limits can illustrate the various ecological, physiological, and evolutionary constraints imposed on a species. Th e range limits of migratory birds are particularly challenging to study as they occur in disjunct regions at diff erent times of the year, which can impose diff erent constraints. Travel between breeding and wintering regions poses a signifi cant energetic and navigational challenge to birds, although it is not clear how these movements infl uence breeding dispersal and range expansion. Here I ask whether the possible costs of migration limit the breeding ranges of wood warblers, a group of birds with an extensive history of ecological and evolutionary studies. I used occurrence records for multiple wood warbler species, breeding primarily in the boreal forest of North America, to generate environmental niche models. I tested for over-prediction of habitat suitability into the western boreal forest, where most these species do not have occurrence records but where there is presumably suitable habitat. I found that some of these vagile taxa, primarily found east of the Rocky Mountains, also have predicted habitat suitability that extends into the north and west, where they have little to no occurrence records. I discuss several possible explanations for this discordance. In particular, the patterns are consistent with the costs of a long-distance migration limiting the benefi ts of range expansion, as migration may become too onerous as the distance between breeding and wintering areas increases. Th ese results speak to the process of niche fi lling more generally and call attention to an under-appreciated explanation for why migratory species may not fully occupy their fundamental niche.},

  abstract = {The concept of retention forestry brings a new point of view for forest management as more emphasis is put on what is retained as opposed to what is removed during harvesting. Details of retention harvesting prescriptions vary among forest ecosystems reflecting differences in their disturbance dynamics, stand composition and condition, and landscape context. Although recent studies underlie the important role of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) in cavity networks of Canadian western temperate forests, limited information exists for conifer-dominated forests such as the black spruce (Picea mariana) forests of central Quebec where the proportion of deciduous trees is generally {$<$}10\%. We used the habitat requirements of an ecosystem engineer of eastern boreal forests, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), to determine harvesting prescriptions likely to preserve most of the biodiversity of this ecosystem. We describe the mean physical characteristics of trees selected for nesting, quantify nesting habitat selection at two scales (nest tree and nesting stand), and identify quantitative targets for forest managers to select types and amounts of retention structures that will offer optimal resources to cavity nesting birds and dead wood associated species in managed boreal landscapes. During the three years of this project, we found 18 Black-backed Woodpecker nests: 9 were in old coniferous, 6 in young cuts, and 1 nest in each of the other habitats (barren land, young coniferous and old cut). Selection of nest trees by Black-backed Woodpeckers was influenced primarily by tree species (jack pine; Pinus banksiana) and also by the dbh of trees, while their selection of nesting stand habitat was influenced positively by the mean density of recent-solid snags and negatively by the mean basal area of live trees. Our results show that forest stands with {$>$}= 200 recently decayed snags/ha ({$>$}= 9 cm dbh) exhibit higher predicted probability of selection for nesting by Black-backed Woodpeckers, and most of the cutblocks with a nest tree originate from harvesting with advance regeneration protection with at least that many snags. Moreover, cutblocks should contain suitable candidate nest trees, with retention of {$<$}= 10 live and dead trees/ha with a dbh {$>$}= 27 cm, and retention of jack pine snags in proportion of their availability before harvesting in black spruce-dominated forest stands. We recommend that, where forest stands present suitable structures, every stand harvested with retention harvesting should retain {$>$}= 200 recent-solid snags/ha ({$>$}= 9 cm dbh), which represents about 1 recent-solid snag each 7 m (50 m(2)). The medium and long-term persistence of dead wood associated species may not rely only on retention forestry, thus we recommend the protection of patches (100 ha) of old forest stands ({$>$}= 120 y) inside these agglomeration of cutblocks to ensure the dynamic of dead wood creation within the managed landscape.

Open-access electronic databases provide unprecedented access to these data, but their usefulness in characterizing species distributions and patterns in biodiversity depend on how complete species inventories are at a given survey location and how uniformly distributed survey locations are along dimensions of time, space, and environment. Our aim was to compare completeness and coverage among three open-access databases representing ten taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, freshwater bivalves, crayfish, freshwater fish, fungi, insects, mammals, plants, and reptiles) in the contiguous United States. We compiled occurrence records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), and federally administered fish surveys (FFS). We aggregated occurrence records by 0.1\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 0.1\textdegree{} grid cells and computed three completeness metrics to classify each grid cell as well-surveyed or not. Next, we compared frequency distributions of surveyed grid cells to background environmental conditions in a GIS and performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to quantify coverage through time, along two spatial gradients, and along eight environmental gradients. The three databases contributed {$>$}13.6 million reliable occurrence records distributed among {$>$}190,000 grid cells. The percent of well-surveyed grid cells was substantially lower for GBIF (5.2\%) than for systematic surveys (BBS and FFS; 82.5\%). Still, the large number of GBIF occurrence records produced at least 250 well-surveyed grid cells for six of nine taxonomic groups. Coverages of systematic surveys were less biased across spatial and environmental dimensions but were more biased in temporal coverage compared to GBIF data. GBIF coverages also varied among taxonomic groups, consistent with commonly recognized geographic, environmental, and institutional sampling biases. This comprehensive assessment of biodiversity data across the contiguous United States provides a prioritization scheme to fill in the gaps by contributing existing occurrence records to the public domain and planning future surveys.},

The independent effects of forest cover and forest fragmentation on the distribution of forest breeding birds were studied in 94 landscapes, 10 10 km each, ranging in forest cover from 2.5\% to 55.8\%. For each landscape, percent forest cover was measured, and a fragmentation index (independent of forest cover) was generated using PCA from the measures of mean forest patch size, number of forest patches, and total forest edge. Presence of 31 forest breeding bird species in each landscape was determined using Breeding Bird Atlas data. The effects of forest cover and forest fragmentation on species presence were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. All responses of individual species to forest cover were positive. Responses to forest fragmentation were weak and variable. There were only two species for which the interaction between cover and fragmentation was significant (one positive, one negative). We found no evidence for the hypothesized negative interaction effect between forest cover and forest fragmentation on species distribution. We conclude that (1) forest cover at the 10 10 km (Universal Transverse Mercator [UTM]) scale has a positive effect on the distribution of forest breeding birds, (2) forest fragmentation does not have a consistent negative effect on the distribution of forest breeding birds, (3) the effect of forest cover is greater than that of forest fragmentation, (4) responses to forest fragmentation are generally weak and highly variable among species, and (5) the effect of forest fragmentation on species distribution does not increase with decreasing forest cover. These results suggest that con-servationists' primary focus should be on preventing a decrease in forest cover. They should not be misled by recent discussions of ''fragmentation effects'' to think that the negative effects of forest loss can somehow be countered by careful consideration of the spatial pattern of remaining forest. Our results indicate that they cannot.},

OBJECTIVE To assess the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events following substitution of warfarin formulations in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS Historical cohort analysis was performed using a commercial insurance claims database. Adults with a diagnosis of AF between January 2003 and December 2007, with 16 or more months of continuous eligibility, a warfarin prescription within 30 days after index AF diagnosis, and at least 3 warfarin prescription fills during the follow-up period were included. Individuals with AF diagnosis or warfarin prescription during the pre-index period were excluded. Cox proportional hazard regression models controlling for sex and baseline comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index, CCI) were used to evaluate the risks of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events following warfarin formulation switches. RESULTS Of 37,756 subjects included in the analysis (mean age 70.96 years, 42.3\% females), 12,996 (34.4\%) switched warfarin formulations, 20,292 (53.7\%) used only 1 generic product, and 4468 (11.8\%) used only Coumadin during follow-up. Compared with continued use of Coumadin, switching from that product to the generic formulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of thrombotic events (HR = 1.81; 95\% CI 1.42 to 2.31). Similar findings were observed for switching from generic warfarin to Coumadin (HR = 1.76; 95\% CI 1.35 to 2.30), and from 1 generic to another generic product (HR = 1.89; 95\% CI 1.57 to 2.29). Similarly, switching from Coumadin to generic warfarin (HR = 1.51; 95\% CI 1.17 to 1.93), generic warfarin to Coumadin (HR = 1.60; 95\% CI 1.23 to 2.1), and from 1 generic to another generic product (HR = 1.74; 95\% CI 1.45 to 2.11) were associated with significantly higher risk of hemorrhage than remaining on Coumadin. CONCLUSIONS Switching warfarin formulations exposed patients with AF to a higher risk of bleeding events compared to remaining on a single product. Maintaining patients on a product with consistent bioavailability may optimize the risk-benefit balance of anticoagulation therapy.},

Land managers need new tools, such as spatial models, to aid them in their decision-making processes because managing for biodiversity, water quality, or natural disturbance is challenging, and landscapes are complex and dynamic. Spatially explicit population models are helpful to managers because these models consider both species-habitat relationships and the arrangement of habitats in space and time. The visualizations that typically accompany spatially explicit models also permit managers to "see" the effects of alternative management strategies on populations of interest. However, the expense entailed in developing the data bases required for spatially explicit models may limit widespread implementation. In addition, many of the models are developed for one or a few species, and dealing with multiple species in a landscape remains a significant challenge. To be most useful to land managers, spatially explicit population models should be user friendly, easily portable, operate on spatial and temporal scales appropriate to management decisions, and use input and output variables that can be measured affordably.},

In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.},

On Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Louisiana, we used distance sampling during 6 visits to 138 point locations to estimate avian densities within stands subjected to variable-retention harvests, within a 13-year chronosequence, and untreated control stands. Densities of 9 species, including 6 species of conservation concern, were greater in treated stands than on untreated stands. Five species responded negatively to treatments and had greater densities in untreated control stands. Based on conservation concern scores established by Partners in Flight and annual detections of each of 30 species, treated stands afforded greater community-wide bird conservation than did untreated stands. For most species, maximum treatment response was between 5 years and 8 years posttreatment with duration of treatment effect {$<$}13 years. Therefore, habitat conditions on treated stands should be reevaluated at circa 15-year intervals and, if warranted, additional silvicultural treatment prescribed to rejuvenate habitat conditions.

  abstract = {Mortality of retained trees can compromise the ecological objectives of variable-retention harvest. We used a large-scale experiment replicated at six locations in western Washington and Oregon to examine the influences of retention level (40\% vs. 15\% of original basal area) and its spatial pattern (aggregated vs. dispersed) on the rate and form of tree mortality for 11-12 years following harvest. Cumulative mortality of conifers was greater at lower levels of retention and in dispersed treatments a result common to most seral groups and canopy strata. The greatest losses, averaging 18\% of stems, occurred at low levels of dispersed retention. Mortality peaked in the first year in dispersed treatments and at low levels of aggregated retention, then rates declined to levels comparable to the controls (similar to 0.8\% of stems/year). Harvest-related bole damage common in the dispersed treatments did not increase risk of mortality. Standing dead accounted for most mortality at greater levels of retention, but uprooting was nearly as common at lower retention particularly in dispersed treatments. Forest aggregates (1 ha in size) did not exhibit greater overall mortality than controls. In fact, at 40\% retention, mortality rates were reduced in the aggregates due to greater survival of late-seral and suppressed stems, presumably a response to edge creation and increased resource supply. Although cumulative mortality was no higher at 15\% retention, larger harvest-unit openings and greater exposure of aggregates resulted in greater uprooting among dead trees. Current standards and guidelines for retention harvests on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest require a minimum of 15\% retention within each harvest unit, with 70\% of this distributed in aggregates of {$>$}= 0.2 ha. Our results suggest that these minimum standards lead to greater risk of tree mortality in dispersed settings and to elevated rates of uprooting regardless of pattern, potentially compromising the objectives of live-tree retention. However, with larger (1-ha) aggregates and moderate levels of retention, managers have considerable flexibility in implementing variable retention without risk of excessive mortality.

We compared survival and height growth of planted conifers and density and seral composition of natural regeneration among treatments with differing retention levels (15\% versus 40\%) and patterns (dispersed versus aggregated) replicated across a range of latitudes and forest zones. We also assessed plot-scale relationships of natural regeneration with overstory density and basal area, competing vegetation, and slash accumulations. Early (1- to 2-year) survival of planted seedlings was greater in dispersed treatments (Pinus monticola Douglas ex D. Don, Abies spp.) or unaffected by retention level or pattern (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Later (5- to 12-year) survival did not differ (all species), but growth was distinctly reduced in dispersed treatments and (or) at higher levels of retention. Density of natural regeneration was 1.5-2.5 times greater in dispersed treatments than in the cleared areas of aggregated treatments. Low-level dispersed retention promoted Pseudotsuga, the early-seral dominant, presumably by enhancing seed rain within a relatively high-light environment. Dispersed retention favored late-seral conifers. The ability to manipulate retention pattern and level to influence regeneration density and composition provides managers with flexibility in developing structurally complex and compositionally diverse forests.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-based management, now a dominant forestry paradigm, implies reducing the gap between variability of natural and managed forests (i.e. ecological distance) to reconcile ecological issues with production of socioeconomic services. Here, we tested whether a trade-off exists between conserving key ecosystem attributes of natural forests and maintaining and/or increasing merchantable wood production at the stand scale in humid boreal stands. Using 20-y data from an experimental design comparing silviculture scenarios of increasing intensity, (i) careful logging around advance growth (CLAAG); (ii) CLAAG followed by pre-commercial thinning; (iii) plantation followed by mechanical release; and (iv) plantation followed by chemical release, we examined plant community composition, stand structure and the quantity and the quality of snags. We also assessed timber productivity by comparing scenarios in terms of conifer and merchantable (diameter at breast height {$>$} 9 cm) tree dimensions. We used data from stands originating from a spruce budworm outbreak as a baseline to understand scenario impacts on variability of key attributes and productivity. Our results showed increasing differences in these attributes between natural and managed stands with increasing silviculture intensity: the diameter structure became more homogenized, light demanding species richness and abundance increased and the quantity and the quality of snags decreased. Therefore, our results showed that the ecological distance from naturally disturbed stands was lower after CLAAG than after the other silviculture scenarios. However, CLAAG favored an increase in the density of deciduous trees and a decrease of conifer snag density that have the potential to affect resilience of mature stands. Pre-commercial thinning resulted in crop trees reaching larger diameter than following CLAAG only and in the decrease of birch tree density, with no effect on deciduous regeneration density {$>$}= 60 cm in height. We measured higher basal area of merchantable trees in plantations than in stands originating from natural regeneration scenarios, with mechanical and chemical release scenarios resulting in similar crop tree productivity. Globally, our study confirmed a general antagonism between the impacts of silviculture on key ecosystem attributes and forest productivity, posing a challenge for reconciling ecological issues with the production of socioeconomic services. At the stand level, results support that retention forestry could emulate natural disturbances by conserving biological legacies during harvest in humid boreal forests. Further research is needed to determine retention parameters to achieve expected wood production while maintaining variability of key attributes in humid boreal forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The first order lidar raster layers described in this document are a suite of descriptive statistic raster layers calculated from lidar point data. They are created using FUSION software and the LTK processing workflow both developed by Bob McGaughey at the Pacific Northwest Research Station. For more information about the FUSION software and the LTK lidar processing workflow, please refer to RSAC's Advanced Lidar Processing Tutorial (FSWeb Link: Depending on the study area, separate runs of the LTK processing workflow may be required in order to generate metrics appropriate for describing unique vegetation types with significantly different canopy structure characteristics. Creating lidar metrics for specific vegetation types can help to ensure that canopy height distribution and density statistics are reasonable. For example, multiple LTK runs with different height and canopy cover threshold parameters may be needed in study areas spanning multiple forest types, where tree species differ significantly in terms of canopy height and growth pattern. Expert knowledge of the forest vegetation types of interest should inform the threshold parameters that are used. For example, higher height and cover cutoff threshold values are typically applied where forest canopies are dominated by taller tree species and lower cutoff values are often used in forest canopies dominated by smaller stature species. Refer to figure 1 (below) for a comparison of how two plots in different example vegetation types appear in the lidar point cloud. In this example, metrics applicable to the taller vegetation type (mixed-conifer forest) were processed with higher height and cover cutoff values. Owing to characteristically small stature of the second (woodland) vegetation type, a lower height and cover cutoff value were used. Vegetation type specific metrics are typically generated wall-to-wall for the study area with the understanding that additional information describing forest type will be considered to guide their appropriate application in inventory modeling and/or in support of management activities. The same suite of metrics are generally generated for the different vegetation types, the key difference being the height and cover thresholds used for height statistics and density calculations.},

Voluntary carbon trading is currently the only option to pursue and reward carbon sequestration by forestry activities. Carbon credits for enhanced sequestration can be sold to partners wishing to offset their own emissions. Here we illustrate the steps taken to design guidelines for the generation of voluntary carbon credits by improved forest management in Piemonte, Italy. The guidelines have been developed in a joint effort by academia, regional administrations, forest owners and professional consultants. In particular, we show how to compute the baseline and the additionality of credit-generating forest management activities, and how to reconcile the generation of forest carbon credits with law requirements, technical limitations, and the provision of other ecosystem services. To illustrate the profitability of carbon credit generation, we simulated the application of carbon credit guidelines to two forest-rich mountain watersheds in the southern part of the Piemonte region. The two dominating tree species are beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.). We computed current forest carbon stock and carbon credits generated in 20 years under business as usual and an alternative biomass retention scenario. The IFM resulted in an avoided harvest of 39,362 m(3) for a net total of 64,014 MgCO(2)e after subtracting harvest emissions, or 38 Mg ha(-1) throughout the permanence period of 20 years. These steps can be replicated in other mountain regions where there is interest in promoting this ecosystem service as an alternative or an addition to production-oriented forest management.},

We observed that, while Lcv N 0.5 may represent forests with large tree size inequality, LskewN 0 can be an indicator for areas lacking a closed dominant canopy. Lcv= 0.5 discriminated forests with trees of approximately equal sizes (even tree size classes) from those with large tree size inequality (uneven tree size classes) with kappa {$\kappa$} = 0.48 and overall accuracy OA = 92.4\%, while Lskew = 0 segregated oligophotic and euphotic zones with {$\kappa$} = 0.56 and OA = 84.6\%. We showed that a supervised classification could only marginally improve some of these accuracy results. The rule-based approach presents a simple method for detecting structural properties key to tree competition and potential for natural regeneration. The study was carried out with low-density datasets from the national program on ALS surveying of Finland, which shows potential for replication with the ALS datasets typically acquired at nationwide scales. Since the presented method was based on deductive mathematical rules for describing distributions, it stands out from inductive supervised and unsupervised classification methods which are more commonly used in remote sensing. Therefore, it presents an opportunity for deducing physical relations which could partly eliminate the need for supporting ALS applications with field plot data for training and modelling, at least in Boreal forest ecosystems.},

Empirical support of this idea is weak in terrestrial systems, though tests of fragmentation effects are typically confounded with landscape composition and potentially obscured by imperfect detection. Here, we used multispecies occupancy models and a mensurative experimental design to test competing hypotheses about how forest fragmentation influences distributions of breeding forest bird species and communities. Location Southern Indiana, USA. Methods During the breeding seasons of 2011-2013, we recorded over 80,000 bird detections in 202 forest fragments using a sampling design that isolated the effects of patch size per se from the effects of forest amount within a 2 km radius, edge distance, local vegetation and sampling area. We modelled the effects of these covariates on distributions of individual species categorized by ecological trait groups (i.e., forest, forest interior or forest edge), and evaluated how forest loss and fragmentation impact species richness. Results Though our results indicated little effect of patch size on total species richness, decreasing patch size had a negative effect on interior species, and a positive effect on edge species. The effects of total forest amount were much more variable, and surprisingly had a negative influence on many species, particularly cavity nesters. Main conclusions Our results do not support theoretical predictions that forest patch size should positively influence bird species richness. However, composition of bird communities shifted towards edge species from interior species with decreasing patch size. Maintaining large forest patches is thus critical for supporting forest interior species, which tend to be of the greatest conservation concern.},

We analyzed the characteristics of very large trees in one of the few stands of lowland old-growth beech forest in Northwestern Europe, regenerated around 1775 and left unmanaged since 1986. We examined their density, diameter range, increment, mortality rate and spatial distribution, based on repeated full dendrometric surveys. In order to evaluate the results, we compared them to original datasets from primary and secondary old-growth beech forests in Europe, and an extensive reference table, compiled from inventories and literature. In our study site, the density of very large trees increased from 31.5 to 34.3 trees ha(-1) over the last 25 years, reaching a median DBH of 97 cm (mean 98.9), with the largest tree attaining a DBH of 159 cm. Although the trees were over 240 years old, they still showed an average DBH increment of 4.75 mm year(-1) and a low mortality rate (0.89\% year(-1)), indicating that they were still vital. These figures are remarkably high compared to other old-growth beech forest reference sites, where the density of very large trees generally varies between 5 and 20 trees ha(-1) (median value 13.1), with a median diameter of 85-90 cm and maximum DBH for beech trees rarely exceeding 100-130 cm. The regular spatial distribution pattern of the very large trees in the studied stand clearly differed from a typical old-growth stand, in which very large trees are randomly distributed. Over the last 25 years though, because of random mortality and ingrowth, the spatial distribution gradually became more random. The extraordinary densities and sizes of the very large trees in our study site can be explained by the favorable climate and site conditions that promote high increments, in combination with the former management interventions of tending and thinning that resulted in continuous non-suppressed growth. Although derived from a very specific case with particular conditions, our observations may be relevant to other beech forests, as they tend to reset certain baseline assumptions for tree size and longevity potential of beech in Northwestern Europe.},

  abstract = {Variable retention is an alternative harvesting system that could be implemented instead the more traditional ones (e.g. shelterwood cut for N. pumilio forests in southern Patagonia), because it was designed not only for timber purpose, but also for conservation. However, the impact of different retention types on diversity is not clear, e.g. stenotopic and eurytopic bird species. The objective of this work was to analyse the habitats (inside, edge or outside of aggregated retention) and the use of strata (canopy, stem, debris and floor) for different bird species under two different variable retention harvesting types (aggregated I dispersed retentions, or aggregated retention + clear-cuts). We analysed four years of bird observation data in variable retention harvested and unharvested forest permanent plots located in Tierra del Fuego province (Argentina) belonging to PEBANPA (Parcelas de Ecologia y Biodiversidad de Ambientes Naturales en Patagonia Austral) network, also with understory and crown cover data. Statistical analysis included uni- and multivariate tests, and comparisons with unharvested forests. We inventoried nine bird species, six of which showed significantly different habitat preference in variable retention types (Carduelis barbata, Phrygilus patagonicus and Tachycineta leucopyga in aggregated + dispersed retentions, and Enicognathus ferrugineus, P. patagonicus, T leucopyga, Troglodytes aedon and Zonotrichia capensis in aggregated retention clearcuts). Likewise, all evaluated species presented differential use of strata, and some species changed comparing harvested and unharvested forests. DCA (Detrended Corresponded Analysis) highlighted association between species and habitats (e.g. P. patagonicus is more related to outside aggregated retentions) as well as differences between variable retention types, showing that bird species move toward edges when clear-cuts were carried out, among aggregated retention, instead of dispersed retention. These results support the effectiveness of the variable retention to conserve habitat of bird species inside managed forests, which satisfy both stenotopic and eurytopic species requirements.},

  abstract = {Mapping of oil reserves involves the use of seismic lines (linear disturbances) to determine both their location and extent. Conventional clearing techniques for seismic assessment have left a legacy of linear disturbances that cause habitat fragmentation. Little is known, however, about how local and landscape factors affect natural regeneration patterns of trees and shrubs on seismic lines that facilitate mapping and future projections of regeneration patterns. To understand factors affecting early forest regeneration and to predict future trends in regeneration of legacy seismic lines we used LiDAR, forest stand databases and a disturbance inventory of conventional seismic lines to model seismic line regeneration to a 3 m height in a 1806 km(2) area in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Regeneration to 3 m was inversely related to terrain wetness, line width, proximity to roads (as a proxy for human use of lines), and the lowland ecosites. Overall, terrain wetness and the presence of fen ecosites had the strongest negative effect on regeneration patterns; the wettest sites failed to recover even after 50 years post-disturbance. Predictions of future regeneration rates on existing lines suggested that approximately one-third of existing linear disturbance footprints in this boreal landscape will remain un-regenerated 50 years later resulting in persistent habitat fragmentation. Model predictions estimating regeneration probability are particularly valuable for estimating current and future forest regeneration trajectories on linear disturbances which are a conservation concern and a focus for restoration and planning by government, industry and conservation organizations.

  abstract = {Boreal forest birds have adapted to changes caused by natural disturbances such as fire and this adaptation forms the basis for the Natural Disturbance Paradigm (NDP) underlying recent proposed changes in forest harvesting practices in western Canada. To date, this paradigm has been evaluated primarily at the stand level and within conventional harvesting systems. The potential for improvements in avian conservation at the landscape scale by adopting the NDP approach is largely unknown. We examined the effects of landscape-scale disturbances on forest bird communities by contrasting richness and abundance of birds in (1) 16 single-pass harvest sites with residual forest patches, (2) 29 multi-pass harvest sites with residuals; and (3) 15 salvage-logged post-fire sites with variable harvest intensity. We contrasted bird communities in these treatments with those in unsalvaged post-fire sites of similar age. Post-fire sites were used to provide a metric of the Natural Range of Variation (NRV) to be expected in bird communities. Sites were surveyed for avian community composition and abundance 1-5 years post-disturbance. Redundancy analysis indicated that bird communities differed from the NRV in all of the harvest treatments. However, single-pass harvests provided a somewhat better fit to NRV than did multi-pass harvesting. Avian community similarity was influenced by non-linear responses to area harvested, amount of residual retention, residual composition and pre-disturbance forest composition. An optimization routine created from a General Linear Model, suggests that community similarity to NRV can be maximized by using single-pass harvests over multi-pass harvests, harvesting 66-88\% of the timber in the planning unit, and retaining 5-19\% of the disturbance area as live residual patches, with 50\% of harvests having at least 9\% of the area in residuals.

  abstract = {Acoustic recordings are increasingly used to quantify occupancy and abundance in avian monitoring and research. The recent development of relatively inexpensive programmable autonomous recording units (ARUs) has further increased the utility of acoustic recording technologies. Despite their potential advantages, persistent questions remain as to how comparable data are between ARUs and traditional (human observer) point counts. We suggest that differences in counts obtained from ARUs versus human observers primarily stem from differences in the effective detection radius of humans (EDRH) versus ARUs (EDRA). We describe how paired sampling can be used in conjunction with generalized linear (GLM) or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to estimate correction factors ({$\delta$}) to remove biases between ARUs and traditional point counts. Furthermore, if human observers conduct distance estimation, we show that density estimates can be derived from single ARUs by estimating EDRA as a function of EDRH and {$\delta$}, thus providing alternatives to more complicated and expensive approaches. We demonstrate our approach using data from 363 point count stations in 105 unique boreal study sites at which field staff conducted point count surveys that were simultaneously recorded by an ARU and later transcribed in the lab. Finally, we used repeated random subsampling of the data to split the data into model creation (70\%) and validation (30\%) subsets to iteratively estimate {$\delta$} and validate density estimates from ARUs against densities calculated from human observers at the same independent validation locations. We modeled density of 35 species of boreal forest birds and show that incorporating {$\delta$} in statistical offsets successfully removes systematic biases in estimated avian counts and/or density between human and ARU derived surveys. Our method is therefore easily implemented and will facilitate the integration of ARU and human observer point count data, facilitating expanded monitoring efforts and meta-analyses with historic point count data.},

  abstract = {Community ecology is often perceived as a "mess," given the seemingly vast number of processes that can underlie the many patterns of interest, and the apparent uniqueness of each study system. However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species-the subjectmatter of community ecology-are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.

  abstract = {Much of Canada's terrestrial biodiversity is supported by boreal forests. Natural resource development in boreal forests poses risks to this biodiversity. This paper reviews the scientific literature to assess the effects of natural resource development on terrestrial biodiversity in Canadian boreal forests. We address four questions: (1) To what extent have Canadian boreal forests changed due to natural resource development? (2) How has biodiversity responded to these changes? (3) Will the biodiversity of second-growth forests converge with that of primary boreal forests? (4) Are we losing species from boreal forests? We focus on trees, understory plants, insects, fungi, selected mammals, and songbirds because these groups have been most studied. We review more than 600 studies and found that changes in community composition are prevalent in response to large-scale conversion of forest types, changes in stand structures and age distributions, and altered landscape structure resulting from forest management and habitat loss associated with other developments such as oil and gas, hydroelectric, and mining. The southern boreal forest has been more highly impacted than the north due to more extensive forest management and the cumulative effects of multiple forms of development. There is abundant evidence that most species are not in danger of being extirpated from the boreal forest due to these anthropogenic changes. A few species, including woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), have, however, undergone long-term range contractions. Significant gaps in our ability to assess the effects of natural resource development on biodiversity in the boreal zone are the lack of long-term spatial and population data to monitor the impact of forest changes on ecosystems and species. R\'esum\'e : Une bonne partie de la biodiversit\'e du Canada se retrouve en for\^et bor\'eale. Le d\'eveloppement des ressources naturelles dans des for\^ets bor\'eales pr\'esente des risques pour cette biodiversit\'e. Les auteurs pr\'esentent une revue de la litt\'erature pour \'evaluer les effets du d\'eveloppement des ressources naturelles sur la biodiversit\'e terrestre dans les for\^ets bor\'eales canadiennes. Ils ont soulev\'e quatre questions : (1) jusqu'\`a quel point les for\^ets bor\'eales canadiennes se sont vues modifi\'ees par le d\'eveloppe-ment des ressources naturelles ? (2) Comment la biodiversit\'e a-t-elle r\'eagi \`a ces changements ? (3) Y aura-t-il convergence de la biodiversit\'e des for\^ets de seconde venue avec celle des for\^ets bor\'eales primaires ? (4) Subissons-nous des pertes d'esp\`eces en for\^ets bor\'eales ? Les auteurs se sont int\'eress\'es en particulier aux arbres, aux plantes de sous-bois, aux insectes, aux champignons, \`a des mammif\`eres et oiseaux chanteurs s\'electionn\'es, car ces groupes ont \'et\'e les plus \'etudi\'es. Ils ont suivi plus de 600 esp\`eces et ont constat\'e que les changements de composition pr\'evalent en r\'eaction \`a des modifications \`a grande \'echelle des types forestiers, des changements de la structure, des classes d'\^age, des modifications aux structures des paysages r\'esultant de l'am\'enagement forestier, ainsi que des pertes d'habitat associ\'ees avec d'autres d\'eveloppements comme l'huile, le gaz, l'hydro\'electricit\'e et les mines. La partie m\'eridionale de la for\^et bor\'eale a re\c{c}u plus d'impacts que la partie nordique suite \`a des am\'enagements forestiers plus intensifs et aux effets cumulatifs des diverses formes de d\'eveloppement. Il y a beaucoup de preuves que la plupart des esp\`eces ne se retrouvent pas en danger d'extinction en for\^ets bor\'eales sous l'influence de modifications anthropog\`enes. Quelques esp\`eces, incluant le caribou forestier (Rangifer tarandus) et l'ours grizzly (Ursus arctos) ont cependant subi des contrac-tions d'habitat \`a long terme.

We compared insular and peninsular residual patches ranging from 0.51 ha to 4.32 ha with plots in dispersed retention and intact forest to evaluate their usefulness to forest birds as habitat in a harvested matrix. We found that forest bird communities were significantly different in all three treatments and that bird communities in patches were an intermediate condition between intact forest and dispersed retention harvest. We observed 12 predominantly forest species, including Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), and Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens), in patches at abundance levels between dispersed retention and intact forest plots. For these species, it appears that patches offer an important habitat in a harvested matrix but at lower abundance than in intact forest. Of the 12 predominantly forest species found in patches, 8 had confirmed breeding. Our results suggest that aggregate retention patches provide breeding quality habitat to a large group of forest species; however, the patches are not equivalent to intact forest suggesting that intact forest should be maintained in landscapes.

Most restoration methods in this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term effects of two restoration treat-ments \textendash{} prescribed burning and gap cutting involving the creation of dead wood \textendash{} on breeding bird assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth ref-erences (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the two census years, we found 1145 ter-ritories of 36 bird species. Total bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments. However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage), we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders, strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest.},

  abstract = {Vegetation structure quantified by light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can improve understanding of wildlife occupancy and species-richness patterns. However, there is often a time lag between the collection of LiDAR data and wildlife data. We investigated whether a time lag between the LiDAR acquisition and field-data acquisition affected mapped wildlife distributions ranging from an individual species distribution to total avian species richness in a conifer forest. We collected bird and LiDAR data in 2009 across a 20,000ha forest in northern Idaho. Using the 2009 LiDAR data, we modelled the probability of occurrence for the brown creeper (Certhia americana). Using the same 2009 LiDAR data, we additionally modelled total avian species richness and richness of three different bird nesting guilds (ground/understory, mid/upper canopy and cavity). We mapped brown creeper occupancy probability and species richness using the 2009 models, and then compared these maps with maps based on the same models applied to a 2003-LiDAR dataset. A prior study identified areas harvested between 2003 and 2009. There was on average a 5\% absolute decrease in mapped probabilities of brown creeper occurrence in non-harvest areas between 2003 and 2009. Species richness changed by less than one species in all cases within non-harvest areas between the 2003 and 2009 maps. Although these comparisons were statistically significant at the p{$<$}0.0001 level, it is likely that the high number of map cells (similar to 480,000) influenced this result. Similar patterns between our 2003 and 2009 maps in non-harvest areas for this suite of avian responses suggests that a 6-year difference between field-data collection and LiDAR-data collection has a minimal effect on mapped avian patterns in an undisturbed coniferous forest. However, because this is one case study in one ecosystem, additional work examining the effect of temporal lags between LiDAR and field-data collection on mapping wildlife distributions is warranted in additional ecosystems.},

Habitat characteristics used in. models typically incorporate (1) field data of limited spatial extent and/or (2) remote sensing data that do not characterize the vertical habitat structure. Remote sensing tools that directly characterize three-dimensional (3-D) habitat structure and that provide data relevant to organism-habitat interactions across a hierarchy of scales promise to improve our understanding of animal-habitat relationships. Laser altimetry, commonly called light detection and ranging (lidar), is a source of geospatial data that can provide fine-grained information about the 3-D structure of ecosystems across broad spatial extents. In this review, we present a brief overview of lidar technology, discuss recent applications of lidar data in investigations of animal-habitat relationships, and propose future applications of this technology to issues of broad species-management and conservation interest.},

However, biodiversity and ecosystem services are often inade-quately accounted for in land use management decisions. Objective We studied a boreal forest ecosystem by linking citizen-science bird data with detailed infor-mation on forest characteristics from airborne laser scanning (ALS). In this paper, we describe this method, and evaluate how similar kinds of biological data sets combined with remote sensing can be used for ecosystem assessments at landscape scale. Methods We analysed data for 41 boreal forest bird species and for 14 structural ALS-based forest parameters. Results The results support the use of the selected method as a basis for quantifying spatially-explicit biodiversity indicators for ecosystem assessments, while suggestions for improvements are also reported. Finally, we evaluate the capacity of those indicators to describe biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships, for example with carbon trade-offs. The results showed clear distinctions between the different spe-cies as measured, for example, by above-ground forest biomass at the observation sites.

  abstract = {Habitat fragmentation has been shown to influence the abundance, movements, and persistence of many species. We asked the following questions: (1) Do species respond mainly to habitat loss or to the changes in habitat configuration resulting from this loss? (2) Do species exhibit sharp thresholds in their response to forest cover or configuration? We compared the relative influence of forest cover and configuration on 15 bird species in 33 landscapes (6.25 km 2) in eastern Ontario, Canada. Forest cover in these landscapes varied between 3.4\% and 66.8\%. The metrics we used to quantify forest configuration were correlated to forest cover, so we regressed these configuration metrics against cover and used the residuals in logistic regression models. Of the 15 forest bird species included in the analyses, the presence of only 3 (Downy Woodpecker [ Picoides pubescens ], Brown Creeper [ Certhia americana ], and White-breasted Nuthatch [ Sitta carolinensis ]) was not significantly related to either cover or configuration of woodland. Forest cover and configuration each were significant predictors of the presence of 6 species in landscapes occupied in both years, and 3 species responded both to cover and configuration. Models based on single years showed variability in the landscape characteristics that were significant predictors of the presence of each species. These results indicate that (1) landscape structure was an important predictor of bird distribution, (2) both forest cover and configuration were important predictors of species presence, and (3) responses were species-specific. Effects of forest cover and configuration on species presence generally were not characterized by sharp thresholds, preventing the application of simple management rules. Although forest cover is an important feature of landscape structure, our results indicate that woodland configuration is a far from negligible component that should also be incorporated in conservation strategies. Efectos de la Fragmentaci\'on Sobre Aves de Bosque: Importancia Relativa de la Cobertura y Configuraci\'on Forestal Resumen: Se ha mostrado que la fragmentaci\'on del h\'abitat influye sobre la abundancia, los movimientos y la persistencia de muchas especies.

Comparamos la influencia relativa de la cobertura forestal y su configuraci\'on sobre 15 especies de aves en 33 localidades (6.25 km 2) en el oriente de Ontario, Canad\'a. La cobertura forestal en esas localidades fluctu\'o entre 3.4\% y 66.8\%.

  abstract = {Abstract. Nitrogen is a key element controlling the species composition, diversity, dynamics, and functioning of many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Many of the original plant species living in these ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and solutions with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics of herbivore populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also are affected by N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other human activities have altered the global cycle of N substantially, generally increasing both the availability and the mobility of N over large regions of Earth. The mobility of N means that while most deliberate applications of N occur locally, their influence spreads regionally and even globally. Moreover, many of the mobile forms of N themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their environmental conse- quences are serious and long term. Based on our review of available scientific evidence, we are certain that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: 1) approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing; 2) increased concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N20 globally, and increased concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the formation of photochemical smog over large regions of Earth; 3) caused losses of soil nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, that are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil fertility; 4) contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams, and lakes in several regions; and 5) greatly increased the transfer of nitrogen through rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans. In addition, based on our review of available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have: 6) increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within terrestrial ecosystems; 7) accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially losses of plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals and microorganisms that depend on them; and 8) caused changes in the composition and functioning of estuarine and nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term declines in coastal marine fisheries.},

  abstract = {In western conifer-dominated forests where the abundance of old-growth stands is decreasing, spe- cies such as the Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) may be useful as indicator species for monitoring the health of old-growth systems because they are strongly associated with habitat characteristics associated with old growth and are especially sensitive to forest management. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is useful for acquiring fine-resolution, three-dimensional data on vegetation structure across broad areas. We evaluated Brown Creeper occupancy of forested landscapes by using lidar-derived canopy metrics in two coniferous forests in Idaho. Den- sity of the upper canopy was the most important variable for predicting Brown Creeper occupancy, although mean height and height variability were also included in the top models. The upper canopy was twice as dense and the mean height was almost 50\% higher at occupied than at unoccupied sites. Previous studies have found indicators of canopy density to be important factors for Brown Creeper habitat; however, this represents the first time that lidar data have been used to examine this relationship empirically through the mapping of the upper canopy density that cannot be continuously quantified by field-based methods or passive remote sensing. Our model's performance was classified as ``good'' by multiple criteria. We were able to map probabilities of Brown Creeper occupancy in \textasciitilde 50 000 ha of forest, probabilities that can be used at the local, forest-stand, and landscape scales, and illustrate the potential utility of lidar-derived data for studies of avian distributions in forested landscapes.},

  abstract = {Post-fire snags provide important resources for cavity nesting communities as well as being subject to timber removal through salvage logging practices. Tools that can characterize their distributions along with other features important as wildlife habitat, such as woody shrub cover, would be useful for research and management purposes. Three dimensional lidar data and Landsat time series disturbance products have both shown varying promise in their ability to characterize aspects of dead biomass and understory cover, but studies exploring the combination of the remote sensing datasets calibrated with field data to model difficult to map habitat components are limited. The purpose of this study was to 1) relate lidar and Landsat time series products to field collected calibration data to produce maps of important post-fire wildlife habitat components including snags of varying sizes and the availability of a woody shrub layer; and 2) compare the individual performance of the Landsat and lidar datasets for predicting the distributions of these difficult to map forest habitat features Using 164 field calibration plots and remote sensing predictors, we modeled and mapped the distributions of our response variables including snag classes (dbh {$>$}= 40 cm; {$>$}= 50 cm, and {$>$}= 75 cm) and woody shrub cover thresholds ({$>$}= 30 and {$>$}= 50\% cover) at 10 m resolutions. Remote sensing predictors included various lidar structure and topography variables and Landsat time series products representing the pre-fire forest, disturbance magnitude, and current forest condition. A model was chosen for mapping purposes using AIC model selection and then by comparing leave-one-out-cross-validation error matrices to choose among competing models. We were able to predict and map all response variables with moderate accuracies and variable sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative) rates. All snag and shrub models were considered to have ``good\{''\} predictive performance as indicated by area under the curve values (0.74-0.91), with percent correctly classified values ranging from 69-85\% when a probability threshold is chosen that balances false positive and false negative errors. Landsat models performed marginally better than lidar structure models according to classification statistics. Landsat-only models had slightly less accuracy than models that included lidar and Landsat data, but often with greater errors than the combined model. The ability to map the response variables with moderate errors and acceptable accuracies for many applications was through the fusion of these remote sensing datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We were able to apply the remote sensing products to map realized habitat relationships for this species of conservation concern in an identified source habitat type, providing a potential resource for local scale conservation and management efforts and adding to the regional knowledge of habitat selection for the Lewis's woodpecker.},

We predicted avian species richness in two mixed conifer forests, Moscow Mountain and Slate Creek, containing different management contexts and located in north-central Idaho. We utilized general linear models and an AIC model selection approach to examine the relative importance of a wide range of remotely-sensed ecological variables, including LiDAR-derived metrics of vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneities of both vegetation and terrain, and Landsat-derived vegetation reflectance indices. We also examined the relative importance of these remotely sensed variables in predicting nesting guild distributions of ground/understory nesters, mid-upper canopy nesters, and cavity nesters. All top models were statistically significant, with adjusted R2s ranging from 0.05 to 0.42. Regardless of study area, the density of the understory was positively associated with total species richness and the ground/understory nesting guild. However, the relative importance of ecological predictors generally differed between the study areas and among the nesting guilds. For example, for mid-upper canopy nester richness, the best predictors at Moscow Mountain included height variability and canopy density whereas at Slate Creek they included slope, elevation, patch diversity and height variability. Topographic variables were not found to influence species richness at Moscow Mountain but were strong predictors of avian species richness at the higher elevation Slate Creek, where species richness decreased with increasing slope and elevation. A variance in responses between focal areas suggests that we expand such studies to determine the relative importance of different factors in determining species richness. It is also important to note that managers using predictive maps should realize that models from one region may not adequately represent communities in other areas. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on polar bears to describe research trends and to assess how effectively research has met management needs. We analyzed 1191 peer-reviewed scientific papers from 1886-2016 covering 24 research topics. Annual counts of papers within each research topic were assessed for temporal trends, spatial coverage, and the extent to which they have facilitated management and monitoring needs. The annual number of papers increased from {$<$}10 in the early 1960s to {$>$}50 in recent years with a mean of 2.2 papers per subpopulation per year with great variation between the 19 global subpopulations. We conclude that there is an imbalance in the geographic and thematic focus of peer-reviewed research in recent years, and that only four subpopulations appear to have had a research focus covering most parameters essential for conservation and sound management.},

  abstract = {A multitude of disturbance agents, such as wildfires, land use, and climate-driven expansion of woody shrubs, are transforming the distribution of plant functional types across Arctic-Boreal ecosystems, which has significant implications for interactions and feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and climate in the northern high-latitudes. However, because the spatial resolution of existing land cover data sets is too coarse, large-scale land cover changes in the Arctic-Boreal region (ABR) have been poorly characterized. Here we use 31 years (1984-2014) of moderate spatial resolution (30 m) satellite imagery over a region spanning 4.7 x 106 km2 in Alaska and northwestern Canada to characterize regional-scale ABR land cover changes. We find that 13.6 +/- 1.3 \% of the domain has changed, primarily via two major modes of transformation: (1) simultaneous disturbance-driven decreases in Evergreen Forest area (-14.7 +/- 3.0 \% relative to 1984) and increases in Deciduous Forest area (+14.8 +/- 5.2 \%) in the Boreal biome; and (2) climate-driven expansion of Herbaceous and Shrub vegetation (+7.4 +/- 2.0 \%) in the Arctic biome. By using time series of 30 m imagery, we characterize dynamics in forest and shrub cover occurring at relatively short spatial scales (hundreds of m) due to fires, harvest, and climate-induced growth that are not observable in coarse spatial resolution (e.g. 500 m or greater pixel size) imagery. Wildfires caused most of Evergreen Forest Loss and Evergreen Forest Gain and substantial areas of Deciduous Forest Gain. Extensive shifts in the distribution of plant functional types at multiple spatial scales are consistent with observations of increased atmospheric CO2 seasonality and ecosystem productivity at northern high latitudes and signal continental-scale shifts in the structure and function of high northern-latitude ecosystems in response to climate change.},

  abstract = {In disturbance-dependent forest ecosystems, species associated with mature forest may maintain their ranges both by persisting in patches of mature forest and by recolonising patches regenerating after fire, harvesting or other disturbances. The null hypotheses are that these processes are both independent of the intensity of disturbance in the landscape surrounding those patches. These were tested in a 1120 km(2) region of tall, wet eucalypt forest in southern Tasmania, which provides a landscape-scale gradient in disturbance intensity shaped by past wildfires and post-European land-use. For all 50 x 50 m cells in the region, a Landscape Disturbance Intensity (LDI) index was calculated based on the vegetation in the surrounding 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 km-radius landscapes. The occurrence of species in three taxonomic groups-birds, vascular plants and flighted beetles-was then sampled in 28 plots (50 x 50 m) across the range of LDI in each of two forest age-classes-mature eucalypt forest (MAT) and 25-50 years-old silvi-cultural regeneration arising from clearfell harvesting (SILV). In both MAT and SILV plots, the occurrences of many common species showed significant relationships with LDI. Most ({$>$} 80\%) of those relationships reflected species that declined in occurrence with increasing LDI, i.e. were Landscape Disturbance-Sensitive (DSL). However, there were contrasting patterns between the forest age classes as well as among the three taxonomic groups in the proportion of common species that were DSL. More plant and bird species were DSL in SILV plots (15/49 and 9/27, respectively) than in MAT plots (4/49 and 1/27, respectively). The dominant fractions of the DSL plant and bird species in SILV plots were classed as rainforest trees or shrubs in previous studies and birds that were associated with MAT plots rather than SILV plots in this study, i.e. species that were also sensitive to disturbance at the patch-scale. A similar number of the common beetle species were DSL in MAT plots (29/234) as in SILV plots (35/234). Beetle species that were Patch Disturbance-Sensitive (DSp) in this study were over-represented in the subset of DSL species in MAT plots (9/29), but not in SILV plots (5/35). We conclude that many DSp species inhabiting mature forest stands are resilient to disturbance in the surrounding landscape, but their ability to recolonise regenerating forest stands can be diminished by disturbance at the landscape-scale. This highlights the role of vegetation structure at both patch and landscape-scales in the long-term viability of mature-forest-dependent species in production-forest landscapes.},

We present a novel and fully automated framework which consists of six components addressing (i) the generation of 2D image representations in the form of range and intensity images, (ii) point quality assessment, (iii) feature extraction and matching, (iv) the forward projection of 2D keypoints to 3D space, (v) correspondence weighting, and (vi) point cloud registration. For the respective components, we take into account different approaches and our main contributions address the issue of how to increase the robustness, efficiency, and accuracy of point cloud registration by either introducing further constraints (e.g., addressing a correspondence weighting based on point quality measures) or replacing commonly applied approaches by more promising alternatives. The latter may not only address the involved strategy for point cloud registration, but also the involved approaches for feature extraction and matching. In a detailed evaluation, we demonstrate that, instead of directly aligning sets of corresponding 3D points, a transfer of the task of point cloud registration to the task of solving the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem or to the task of finding the relative orientation between sets of bearing vectors offers great potential for future research. Furthermore, our results clearly reveal that the further consideration of both a correspondence weighting based on point quality measures and a selection of an appropriate feature detector\textendash descriptor combination may result in significant advantages with respect to robustness, efficiency, and accuracy.},

Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships have been found for most studies investigating animal taxa, although negative relationships also occur and the scale dependence of heterogeneity-diversity relationships is little known. We investigated multi-scale, heterogeneity-diversity relationships for bird communities in a semi-arid riparian landscape, using airborne LiDAR data to derive key measures of structural habitat complexity. Habitat heterogeneity-diversity relationships were generally positive, although the overall strength of relationships varied across avian life history guilds (R2 range: 0.03-0.41). Best predicted were the species richness indices of cavity nesters, habitat generalists, woodland specialists, and foliage foragers. Heterogeneity-diversity relationships were also strongly scale-dependent, with strongest associations at the 200-m scale (4ha) and weakest associations at the 50-m scale (0.25ha). Our results underscore the value of LiDAR data for fine-grained quantification of habitat structure, as well as the need for biodiversity studies to incorporate variation among life-history guilds and to simultaneously consider multiple guild functional types (e.g. nesting, foraging, habitat). Results suggest that certain life-history guilds (foliage foragers, cavity nesters, woodland specialists) are more susceptible than others (ground foragers, ground nesters, low nesters) to experiencing declines in local species richness if functional elements of habitat heterogeneity are lost. Positive heterogeneity-diversity relationships imply that riparian conservation efforts need to not only provide high-quality riparian habitat locally, but also to provide habitat heterogeneity across multiple scales. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

  abstract = {In the past 70years radar technology has been increasingly applied in ornithological research in various geographical areas worldwide and has contributed greatly to a better understanding of bird migration. Many different radar types have been used, such as tracking, ship or weather radars. However, radar wind profilers (RWPs) have been largely neglected in avian research. RWPs continuously measure three-dimensional winds and, despite the low frequency range at which these systems operate, available literature provides evidence that birds are recorded at many sites. So far the potential of RWPs in ornithological research has not been fully explored and studies deal predominantly with birds in the context of clutter removal. However, based on their broad implementation in networks (e.g. E-PROFILE in Europe) situated in areas that are strategically important for bird migration, they could offer a valuable complement to already established or planned large-scale bird monitoring schemes by radar. The objective of this paper is to serve as a reference for those who wish to consider RWP data in a biological context. To that end, we provide an overview of the evolution and establishment of operational RWPs as well as of their mode of operation, in order to depict their role in meteorology and to evaluate their potential in ornithology. The assessment is based on available literature on RWPs and radar ornithology outlining the past, present and potential future role of wind profilers. In the past, birds were discarded as contamination and eliminated as far as possible from the meteorological data. Only recently have the echo signatures of biological targets been scrutinized thoroughly in raw data and used successfully for ornithological investigation. On this basis it is possible to consider the potential future utility of this promising data source as a complement to other remote-sensing instruments and other sampling techniques used in avian research. Weather independence of ornithological information was found to be a particular benefit. However, as the development of the bird-specific method is only in an early stage, more detailed studies are necessary in the future to fully assess the potential of this type of radar.},

Survival of adult songbirds in boreal forest landscapes fragmented by clearcuts and natural openings. Avian Conservation and Ecology -\'Ecologie et conservation des oiseaux 3(1): 5. [online] ABSTRACT. There exists little information on demographic responses of boreal songbirds to logging. We conducted a 4-yr (2003-2006) songbird mark-recapture study in western Newfoundland, where land cover is a naturally heterogeneous mosaic of productive spruce-fir forest, stunted taiga, and openings such as bogs, fens, and riparian zones. We compared apparent survival and rate of transience for adults of 14 species between areas having forests fragmented primarily by either natural openings or 3-7 yr-old clearcuts. Data were collected on three landscape pairs, with birds being marked on three 4-6 ha netting sites on each landscape (total = 18 netting sites). Survival rates were estimated using multi-strata mark-recapture models with landscape types specified as model strata. Landscape type was retained in the best model for only two species, Ruby-crowned Kinglet and Yellow-rumped Warbler, in both cases indicating lower apparent survival in landscapes having clearcuts. Though parameter estimates suggested lower survival in clearcut landscapes for several species, meta-analysis across all species detected no general difference between landscape types. Further, we did not detect any relation between landscape differences in survival and a species' habitat affinity, migratory strategy, or the proportion of transients in its population. Although sensitivity to logging was limited, we observed high interspecific variation in rates of breeding season apparent survival (48\% [Dark-eyed Junco] to 100\% [several species]), overwinter apparent survival (0.3\% [Ruby-crowned Kinglet] to 86.5\% [Gray Jay]), and transience ({$\approx$}0\% [several species] to 61\% [Ruby-crowned Kinglet in clearcut landscapes]). For Lincoln's and White-throated Sparrows, over-winter apparent survival was {$>$}2\texttimes{} higher for males than females, and rate of transience was {$>$} 8\texttimes{} higher for White-throated Sparrow males than females. Moderately male-biased sex ratios suggested that both lower mortality and higher site fidelity contributed to higher apparent survival of males. Overall, variability in our estimates of survival was too great to be explained by mortality alone, suggesting a large influence of landscape-scale movement by adults, e.g., breeding dispersal, extra-territorial forays, and transience, on the dynamics of boreal songbird populations. These movement patterns may also confer resilience to localized disturbance in boreal landscapes. R\'ESUM\'E. Peu d'informations nous permettent de mesurer la r\'eponse d\'emographique des oiseaux bor\'eaux \`a l'exploitation foresti\`ere. Afin de pallier \`a cette situation, nous avons effectu\'e une \'etude par capture-recapture d'une dur\'ee de 4 ans (2003-2006) dans l'ouest de Terre-Neuve, o\`u l'on retrouve une mosa\"ique naturellement h\'et\'erog\`ene de peuplements forestiers productifs d'\'epinettes-sapins, de ta\"iga rabougrie et d'ouvertures telles que des tourbi\`eres, fens et zones riveraines. Nous avons compar\'e le taux de survie apparent et la proportion d'individus en transit pour des adultes de 14 esp\`eces entre des zones de for\^ets principalement fragment\'ees par des ouvertures naturelles versus des coupes \`a blanc de 3 \`a 7 ans. Les donn\'ees ont \'et\'e r\'ecolt\'ees dans trois paires de paysages, les oiseaux \'etant marqu\'es dans trois sites de capture Avian Conservation and Ecology -\'Ecologie et conservation des oiseaux 3(1): 5 http://www.ace-eco.org/vol3/iss1/art5/ de 4 \`a 6 ha dans chaque paysage (total = 18 sites de capture). Les taux de survie ont \'et\'e estim\'es en utilisant des mod\`eles de capture-recapture multi-strates, les types de paysages repr\'esentant les dites strates. La variable \guillemotleft{} type de paysage \guillemotright{} a \'et\'e retenue dans le meilleur mod\`ele chez seulement deux esp\`eces, soit le Roitelet \`a couronne rubis et la Paruline \`a croupion jaune. Dans les deux cas, le taux de survie apparent \'etait inf\'erieur dans les paysages pr\'esentant des coupes \`a blanc. Bien que les estim\'es de param\`etres sugg\'eraient un taux de survie inf\'erieur dans les paysages sous exploitation foresti\`ere pour plusieurs esp\`eces, une m\'eta-analyse pour toutes les esp\`eces n'a permis de d\'etecter aucune diff\'erence g\'en\'erale entre les types de paysages. De plus, nous n'avons pas d\'etect\'e de relation entre les diff\'erences inter-paysages dans le taux de survie et l'affinit\'e des esp\`eces pour diff\'erents types d'habitat, leur strat\'egie migratoire ou la proportion d'individus en transit dans la population. Bien que la sensibilit\'e \`a la coupe \'etait limit\'ee, nous avons observ\'e une variation intersp\'ecifique \'elev\'ee dans les taux de survie apparents durant la saison de nidification (48\% [Junco ardois\'e] \`a 100\% [plusieurs esp\`eces]), les taux de survie apparents durant l'hiver (0,3\% [Roitelet \`a couronne rubis] \`a 86.5\% [M\'esangeai du Canada]) et la proportion d'individus en transit ({$\approx$}0\% [plusieurs esp\`eces] \`a 61\% [Roitelet \`a couronne rubis dans les paysages sous exploitation foresti\`ere]). Pour le Bruant de Lincoln et le Bruant \`a gorge blanche, le taux de survie apparent durant l'hiver \'etait {$>$}2\texttimes{} plus \'elev\'e pour les m\^ales que les femelles et la proportion d'individus en transit \'etait {$>$} 8\texttimes{} plus \'elev\'ee chez les Bruants \`a gorge blanche m\^ales que chez les femelles. Des rapports des sexes mod\'er\'ement biais\'es vers les m\^ales sugg\`erent que la mortalit\'e plus faible et la plus grande fid\'elit\'e au site ont contribu\'e au taux de survie apparent plus \'elev\'e chez les m\^ales. Dans l'ensemble, la variabilit\'e de nos taux de survie estim\'es \'etait trop \'elev\'ee pour s'expliquer uniquement par la mortalit\'e, ce qui sugg\`ere une grande influence des mouvements des adultes \`a l'\'echelle des paysages (ex., dispersion, mouvements exploratoires extra-territoriaux et itin\'erance) dans la dynamique des populations d'oiseaux bor\'eaux. Ces patrons de mouvements peuvent aussi leur conf\'erer une r\'esilience aux perturbations locales dans les paysages bor\'eaux.},

  abstract = {A best practices guide for the use of airborne laser scanning data (ALS; also referred to as Light Detection and Ranging or LiDAR) in forest inventory applications is now available for download from the Canadian Forest Service bookstore (White et al., 2013; http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id= 34887). The guide, produced by the Canadian Forest Service, Natural Resources Canada, brings together state-of-the-art approaches, methods, and data to enable readers interested in using ALS data to characterize large forest areas in a cost-effective manner. The best practices presented in the guide are based on more than 25 years of scientific research on the application of ALS data to forest inventory. The guide describes the entire process for generating forest inventory attributes from ALS data and recommends best practices for each step of the process\textemdash from ground sampling through to metric generation and model development. The collection of ground plot data for model calibration and validation is a crit-ical component of the recommended approach and is described in detail in the guide. Appendices to the guide pro-vide additional details on ALS data acquisition and metric generation. The area-based approach is typically accomplished in two steps (Fig. 1). In the first step, ALS data are acquired for the entire area of interest (wall-to-wall coverage), tree-level meas-ures are acquired from sampled ground plots and summa-rized to the plot level, and predictive models are developed (e.g., using regression or non-parametric methods). For the purposes of model development, the ALS data is clipped to correspond to the area and shape of each ground plot. A set of descriptive statistics (referred to as " metrics ") are calculated from the clipped ALS data and include measures such as mean height, height percentiles, and canopy cover (Woods et al. 2011). Inventory attributes of interest are either measured by ground crews (i.e., height, diameter) or modelled (i.e., vol-ume, biomass) for each ground plot. It is critical that ground plots represent the full range of variability in the attribute(s) of interest and to accomplish this, the use of a stratified sampling approach is recommended, preferably with strata that are defined using the ALS metrics themselves. Thus, the ALS data must be acquired and processed prior to ground sampling. Finally, predictive models are constructed using the ground plot attributes as the response variable and the ALS-derived metrics as predictors. In the second step of the area-based approach, models that were developed using co-located ground plots and ALS data are then applied to the entire area of interest to generate the desired wall-to-wall estimates and maps of specific forest inventory attributes. The same metrics that are calculated for the clipped ALS data (as described above) are generated for the wall-to-wall ALS data and the predictive equations devel-oped from the modelling in the first step are applied to the entire area of interest using the wall-to-wall metrics. The pre-diction unit for this application is a grid cell, the size of which relates to the size of the ground-measured plot. Once the pre-dictive equations are applied to the wall-to-wall ALS data, each grid cell will have an estimate for the attribute of interest. The primary advantage of the area-based approach is hav-ing complete (i.e., wall-to-wall) spatially explicit measures of canopy height, associated metrics, and all modelled attributes for an area of interest (Fig. 2). The area-based approach described in the guide also enables more precise estimates of certain forest variables and the calculation of confidence intervals for stand-level estimates (Woods et al. 2011). Although not dependent on pre-existing photo-interpreted stand boundaries, ALS-based estimates are typically rolled up to the stand or block level (Fig. 1). This ability to scale wall-to-wall ALS-based estimates allows ALS data to be seamlessly integrated into existing conventional stand-level, operational, tactical, or strategic forest inventories, thereby enabling within-polygon variability to be characterized, while at the same time not precluding the implementation of standard or mandated inventory practices. Additional background material and a full listing of rec-ommendations for best practices are provided in the guide. While the guide focuses on the generation of forest inventory attributes from ALS data, there are many additional benefits offered by the ALS data. For example, the generation of a high-quality digital elevation model from the ALS data enables improved planning for road and block layout, slope stability and risk assessment, improved riparian mapping,},

  abstract = {Landsat time series (LTS) enable the characterization of forest recovery post-disturbance over large areas; however, there is a gap in our current knowledge concerning the linkage between spectral measures of recovery derived from LTS and actual manifestations of forest structure in regenerating stands. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data provide useful measures of forest structure that can be used to corroborate spectral measures of forest recovery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of a spectral index of recovery based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR): the years to recovery, or Y2R metric, as an indicator of the return of forest vegetation following forest harvest (clearcutting). The Y2R metric has previously been defined as the number of years required for a pixel to return to 80\% of its pre-disturbance NBR (NBRpre) value. In this study, the Composite2Change (C2C) algorithm was used to generate a time series of gap-free, cloud-free Landsat surface reflectance composites (1985\textendash 2012), associated change metrics, and a spatially-explicit dataset of detected changes for an actively managed forest area in southern Finland (5.3 Mha). The overall accuracy of change detection, determined using independent validation data, was 89\%. Areas of forest harvesting in 1991 were then used to evaluate the Y2R metric. Four alternative recovery scenarios were evaluated, representing variations in the spectral threshold used to define Y2R: 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% of NBRpre, and a critical value of z (i.e. the year in which the pixel's NBR value is no longer significantly different from NBRpre). The Y2R for each scenario were classified into five groups: recovery within {$<$}10 years, 10\textendash 13 years, 14\textendash 17 years, {$>$}17 years, and not recovered. Measures of forest structure (canopy height and cover) were obtained from ALS data. Benchmarks for height ({$>$}5 m) and canopy cover ({$>$}10\%) were applied to each recovery scenario, and the percentage of pixels that attained both of these benchmarks for each recovery group, was determined for each Y2R scenario. Our results indicated that the Y2R metric using the 80\% threshold provided the most realistic assessment of forest recovery: all pixels considered in our analysis were spectrally recovered within the analysis period, with 88.88\% of recovered pixels attaining the benchmarks for both cover and height. Moreover, false positives (pixels that had recovered spectrally, but not structurally) and false negatives (pixels that had recovered structurally, but not spectrally) were minimized with the 80\% threshold. This research demonstrates the efficacy of LTS-derived assessments of recovery, which can be spatially exhaustive and retrospective, providing important baseline data for forest monitoring.},

  abstract = {Successful restoration of degraded forest landscapes requires reference models that adequately capture structural heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales and for specific landforms. Despite this need, managers often lack access to reliable reference information, in large part because field-based methods for assessing variation in forest structure are costly and inherently suffer from limited replication and spatial coverage and, therefore, yield limited insights about the ecological structure of reference forests at landscape scales. LiDAR is a cost-effective alternative that can provide high-resolution characterizations of variation in forest structure among landform types. However, managers and researchers have been reluctant to use LiDAR for characterizing structure because of low confidence in its capacity to approximate actual tree distributions. By calculating bias in LiDAR estimates for a range of tree-height cutoffs, we improved LiDAR's ability to capture structural variability in terms of individual trees. We assessed bias in the processed LiDAR data by comparing datasets of field-measured and LiDAR-detected trees of various height classes in terms of overall number of trees and estimates of structure and spatial pattern in an important contemporary reference forest, the Sierra de San Pedro Martir National Park, Baja California, Mexico. Agreement between LiDAR- and field-based estimates of tree density, as well as estimates of forest structure and spatial pattern, was maximized by removing trees less than 12 m tall. We applied this height cutoff to LiDAR-detected trees of our study landscape, and asked if forest structure and spatial pattern varied across topographic settings. We found that canyons, shallow northerly, and shallow southerly slopes were structurally similar; each had a greater number of all trees, large trees, and large tree clumps than steep southerly slopes and ridges. Steep northerly slopes supported unique structures, with taller trees than ridges and shorter trees than canyons and shallow southerly slopes. Our results show that characterizations of forest structure based on LiDAR-detected trees are reasonably accurate when the focus is narrowed to the overstory. In addition, our finding of strong variation of forest structure and spatial pattern across topographic settings demonstrates the importance of developing reference models at the landscape scale, and highlights the need for replicated sampling among stands and landforms. Methods developed here should be useful to managers interested in using LiDAR to characterize distributions of medium and large overstory trees, particularly for the development of landscape-scale reference models.},

In a randomized complete-block design, six treatments were applied to 13-ha units at three sites (blocks): four retention levels of original basal area (BA) in an aggregated tree pattern (100, 75, 40, and 15\%) and two retention levels in a dispersed tree pattern (15 and 40\%). Log-yarding method differed at each site (suspension cable, shovel-loader, or helicopter). We used an information-theoretic approach to compare six candidate regression models for their ability to predict treatment responses of chipmunk (N) over cap and associated habitat variables. Chipmunk (N) over cap had a positive linear relationship with retention level that predicted a 50\% reduction in abundance as \% BA retention decreased from 100 to 15\% (R-2 = 0.36). Disturbed soil cover was strongly related to the interaction of retention level and block (i.e., yarding method and other site-level differences) (R-2 = 0.82), and the model predicted disproportionately greater disturbed area for cable yarding (16\%) than for shovel (10\%) or helicopter (6\%) methods as retention decreased from 100 to 15\%. Chipmunk (N) over cap had a negative linear relationship with disturbed soil cover that predicted a 70\% reduction in the species' abundance as disturbed area increased from 0 to 16\% (R-2 = 0.53). Retention level and yarding method are important considerations when planning harvesting operations because of their potential impacts to small mammal populations.},

  abstract = {Mature stands, mid-successional communities in which large live trees are the dominant structural feature, are a major component of forested landscapes across North America. Despite this prominence at regional scales, mature stands have rarely been the focus of research on forest carbon dynamics. We utilized an observational study design to (i) examine the medium-term impact of active management on carbon storage in live and dead vegetation in mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco)-dominated stands in western Oregon, and (ii) provide baseline estimates of total non-soil carbon storage during the mature phase of stand development for this forest type. Stands aged 106-193 years at the time of sampling were selected to represent a gradient in harvest intensity, from passive (reserve-based) management, to low-intensity (commercial thinning) and high-intensity (regeneration harvest with structural retention) active management. Active management treatments were implemented following the onset of maturity in stands with no prior management history, and sampling was conducted an average of 38 years and 22 years following treatment (mean for thinned and retention harvest conditions, respectively). Total non-soil carbon storage was significantly greater in stands managed using a reserve-based approach (mean of 575 Mg C ha(-1)) than those subject to retention harvest (mean 257 Mg C ha(-1)) 17 to -34 years previously, but was not different from stands managed over extended rotations with commercial thinning (mean 546 Mg C ha(-1)). A similar trend was evident for carbon storage in live overstory trees, which were also the dominant component of total non-soil carbon in all management conditions. Dead wood pools varied greatly among stands, but estimates did not indicate any systematic differences in carbon storage in dead wood between management conditions. Our results suggest that shifting from passive management to a high-intensity harvest regime in mature Douglas-fir stands will entail substantial reductions in carbon storage. By contrast, managing stands over extended rotations with light thinning may enable the provision of wood products while maintaining relatively high carbon storage in the forest ecosystem. In absolute terms, mean carbon storage across our full sample of unmanaged, low-intensity and high-intensity harvest conditions exceeded previously reported values from inventories of mature plots across a similarly broad range of site conditions, but remains below the potential upper bounds to carbon storage in Douglas-fir-dominated forests. However, total aboveground carbon stocks in excess of 700 Mg ha(-1) in individual mature stands in our dataset implies that, under certain conditions, forest biomass approaches its maximum by the close of the mature phase of stand development in Douglas-fir-dominated forests.},

  abstract = {Identifying suitable habitat is critical to endangered species management and recovery. However, this basic task is often complicated by the rarity of the species in question and the limited availability of high quality environmental data. The endangered Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) occupies early seral shrub communities generated by fire. The ability to predict vegetation structure is particularly important for mapping vireo habitat because this species occupies transitional, non-equilibrium vegetation types. We use presence data for territorial male vireos collected throughout the Fort Hood Military Reservation, Texas, to construct habitat suitability models using vegetation type (mapped from aerial imagery), soil data, and laser altimetry (LiDAR)-derived measures of vegetation structure. LiDAR produces a three-dimensional, high-resolution representation of vegetation structure across broad spatial scales. We built models that incorporated LIDAR outputs as well as the other habitat predictors using a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm, cforest. Models built using a single predictor class (vegetation structure or type or soil) performed similarly across 25 bootstrapped training and test datasets (median accuracies 76\%, 74\%, and 79\%, respectively). Models incorporating two predictor classes performed better (80-81\%) and only slightly worse than the full model (82\%). Furthermore, vegetation type and soil data were more important predictors of habitat suitability than structural measures in the full model. Predictive maps suggest that models incorporating vegetation type and soil would be most useful for habitat conservation and management applications on Fort Hood. The addition of LiDAR-derived variables to the model further distinguishes suitable habitats from potentially suitable but presently overgrown areas. In the absence of detailed vegetation data, models based on structural measures performed well when combined with soil data. This could be useful in a broader regional context in which vireos occupy a greater variety of vegetation types with a common structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Here we demonstrate how to arbitrate among a variety of remotely sensed predictor variables to estimate the distribution and ecological needs of an endangered butterfly species occurring mainly in inaccessible areas. We classified 19 continuous environmental predictor variables into three conceptually independent predictor classes, terrain, land cover, and vertical vegetation structure, and compared the accuracy of competing Maxent habitat models consisting of different combinations of each class. Each class contributed, though disproportionately, to our most reliable model that considered all 19 variables. We confirm that variables obtained from remote sensors can effectively estimate the distribution and ecological needs of a relatively unknown imperiled species occurring in inaccessible locations. Importantly, increasing the variety of predictor classes through multi-sensor fusion resulted in greater model accuracy than increasing the absolute number of predictor variables.},

Both types of targets can be effective, but there are trade-offs, especially for broadly-distributed ecosystems or taxa, such as migratory species, a group for which conservation has been challenged by limited knowledge of distributions throughout the annual cycle. We combined fine scale abundance-based distribution models using crowd-sourced data with population trend analyses to evaluate how conservation targets emphasizing proactive (high species diversity) versus reactive (declining species richness and average severity of decline) approaches influenced spatial priorities for the conservation of Neotropical migratory birds (n=112 species), during the non-breeding period in the Western Hemisphere. We also examined how priority landscapes for each target were affected by the magnitude and changes in human footprint, forest cover, and land protection. Spatial priorities were strikingly different when targets emphasized areas of high species diversity (southern Mexico, northern Central America) versus areas with more severe average declines across species (Andean cordilleras of South America). Targeting richness of declining species was most congruent with high diversity. Only a fraction of non-breeding landscapes (0.03\%), mostly in southern Central America and northern Colombia, were selected across all targets. Priority areas for the most severe average declines across the community were subject to rapid increases in human footprint, unlike areas selected for high diversity or declining species richness. Our results highlight how even different reactive conservation approaches may emphasize different regions with varying threats and opportunities for conservation. Overlap between areas prioritized for the conservation of high species diversity and declining species richness in the northern Neotropics indicate a potential for conservation to support declining species without compromising conservation of diverse communities of Neotropical migrants. However, our study provides new evidence that rapid land conversion in the northern Andes may drive declines of Neotropical migrants overwintering in the region; conserving these communities of Neotropical migrants will require an emphasis on protecting and restoring habitat in northwest South America.},

Thousands of oil and gas wellsites exist in this region that have been actively reclaimed since the 1960s.

Methods that provide spatially accurate data are required to determine impacts of these small disturbances characteristic of energy sector on songbirds. Acoustic localization can be used to determine singing locations, based on time of arrival differences of songs to an array of microphones. We used acoustic localization to determine the assemblage of songbirds on 12 reclaimed wellsites ranging from 7 to 49 years since reclamation, and how the similarity of this assemblage to 12 control mature forest sites (greater than 80 years old) changed with increasing canopy cover on the wellsite. Songbird community composition became more similar to mature forest as canopy cover increased on reclaimed wellsites. Results from this study suggest that wellsite reclamation practices are allowing for initial suitable vegetation recovery, however more research on the effectiveness of different strategies at promoting regeneration of wellsites and subsequent impact on songbird communities is required.},

Our objectives were to analyze the differences between surviving residual trees and those that succumbed to windthrow and to quantify growth release. The treatment was based on harvesting the estimated spruce budworm outbreak mortality, i.e., 90\% of mature balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., 60\% of mature spruce (Picea spp.), and no hardwoods. Windthrow increased with the proportion of trees harvested and averaged 52\% over 7-9 years in these stands with high balsam fir - spruce content. One-third of 42 harvested plots sustained {$>$}30\% windthrow, whereas 73\% of 11 similar unharvested plots had {$<$}10\% windthrow. Balsam fir had higher windthrow than spruce at 53\% and 41\%, respectively. Windthrown balsam fir trees had significantly larger diameters at breast height (DBH, 1.3 m), larger heights, and smaller crown ratios than surviving residual trees. Substantial growth release occurred, with DBH increment of residual trees 48\%-64\% greater than trees in unharvested plots. Balsam fir and intolerant hardwoods exhibited the largest growth response. We suggest that future spruce budworm inspired harvests in stands with high balsam fir - spruce content use two or three entries about 5 years apart to reduce windthrow.},

  abstract = {Forest understory communities are important components in forest ecosystems providing wildlife habitat and influencing nutrient cycling, fuel loadings, fire behavior and tree species composition over time. One of the most widely utilized understory component metrics is understory vegetation cover, often used as a measure of vegetation abundance. To date. understory vegetation cover estimation and prediction has proven to be inherently difficult using traditional explanatory variables such as: leaf area index, basal area, slope, and aspect. We introduce airborne lidar-derived metrics into the modeling framework for understory vegetation cover. A new airborne lidar metric, understory lidar cover density, created by filtering understory lidar points using intensity values increased traditional explanatory power from non-lidar understory vegetation cover estimation models (non-lidar R-2-values: 0.2-0.45 vs. lidar R-2-values: 0.7-0.8). Beta regression, a relatively new modeling technique for this type of data, was compared with a traditional weighted linear regression model using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Both models provided similar understory vegetation cover accuracies (+/- 22\%) and biases (similar to 0\%) using 40.5 m(2) circular plots (n=154). The method presented in this paper provides the ability to accurately obtain census understory vegetation cover information at fine spatial resolutions over a broad range of stand conditions for the interior ponderosa pine forest type. Additional model enhancement and the extension of the method into other forest types warrant further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The magnitude, duration, and frequency of forest disturbance caused by the spruce budworm and forest tent caterpillar in northern Minnesota and neighboring Ontario, Canada have increased over the last century due to a shift in forest species composition linked to historical fire suppression, forest management, and pesticide application that has fostered increased dominance of host tree species. Modeling approaches are currently being used to understand and forecast potential management effects in changing insect disturbance trends. However, detailed forest composition data needed for these efforts is often lacking. We used partial least squares (PLS) regression to integrate different combinations of satellite sensor data including Landsat, Radarsat-1, and PALSAR, as well as pixel-wise forest structure information derived from SPOT-5 sensor data (Wolter et al., 2009), to determine the best combination of sensor data for estimating near species-level proportional forest composition (12 types: 10 species and 2 genera). Single-sensor and various multi-sensor PLS models showed distinct species-dependent sensitivities to relative basal area (BA), with Landsat variables showing greatest overall sensitivity. However, best results were achieved using a combination of data from all these sensors, with several C-band (Radarsat-1) and L-band (PALSAR) variables showing sensitivity to the composition and abundance of specific species. Pixel-level forest structure estimates derived from SPOT-5 data were generally more sensitive to conifer species abundance (especially white pine) than to hardwood species composition. Relative BA models accounted for 68\% (jack pine) to 98\% (maple spp.) of the variation in ground data with RMSE values between 2.46\% and 5.65\% relative BA, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the effective lower limits of usefulness of species relative BA estimates which ranged from 5.94\% (jack pine) to 39.41\% (black ash). These estimates were then used to produce a dominant forest species map for the study region with an overall accuracy of 78\%. Most notably, this approach facilitated discrimination of aspen from paper birch as well as spruce and fir from other conifer species which is crucial for the study of forest tent caterpillar and spruce budworm dynamics in the Upper Midwest. We also demonstrate that PLS regression is an effective data fusion strategy for mapping composition of heterogeneous forests using satellite sensor data. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

However, economical, comprehensive monitoring is needed to advance understanding of the effectiveness of these management strategies through time. We investigate multitemporal winter Landsat sensor data (capturing snow ground cover at 7.6 cm and 106.7 cm depths) as a tool for discriminating between and providing regional estimates of both residual forest basal area (BA) and downed coarse woody material (DCWM) volume following retention harvesting in Minnesota, USA. Measurements from 34 ground plots were used with Landsat predictor variables to estimate these two biophysical forest parameters. According to similar studies, results for DCWM volume estimation are considered adequate, with an R-adj(2) = 0.54 and absolute RMSE (RMSEa) = 19.02 m(3).ha(-1). Residual forest BA estimates were similar: total BA R-adj(2) = 0.55 (RMSEa = 1.85 m(2).ha(-1)), hardwood BA R-adj(2) = 0.67 (RMSEa = 1.23 m(2).ha(-1)), and conifer BA R-adj(2) = 0.52 (RMSEa = 0.94 m(2).ha(-1)). Use of winter Landsat imagery was key to quantifying these important forest biophysical parameters-a tool that carries the potential to transform our understanding of the impact of human and natural disturbance regimes on northern forest ecosystems.},

The amount and configuration of mature and regenerating forest in the landscape (landscape structure) influences habitat suitability for mature-forest-associated species. We applied spatial analysis to describe the landscape structure of three wet eucalypt forest landscapes in south-eastern Australia and used the results from empirical biodiversity studies to frame interpretation of possible impacts on habitat suitability. We determined the extent of structurally mature forest, its reservation status, and the extent to which it may be edge affected. We also assessed how landscape structure potentially impacts the re-establishment of mature-forest-associated species into previously harvested areas through the proximity to (mature forest influence)-and extent of (landscape context)-mature forest in the surrounding landscape. Our analyses were designed to inform forest management initiatives that draw on these landscape-scale concepts. Central Highlands Victoria had less structurally mature eucalypt forest (4\%) compared to North West Tasmania (14\%) and Southern Forests Tasmania (21\%). Detrimental effects of edge influence on structurally mature forest appeared relatively minor. Low levels of mature forest influence combined with low-medium surrounding mature forest cover (landscape context) indicate potential limitations on recolonisation of coupes by mature-forest-associated species. Our results vindicate the recent shift toward variable retention silviculture and landscape context planning. Our approach to landscape analysis provides a useful framework for other managed forest landscapes.},

  abstract = {Wildfire is an important disturbance agent in Canada's boreal forest. Optical remotely sensed imagery (e.g., Landsat TM/ETM+), is well suited for capturing horizontally distributed forest conditions, structure, and change, while Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data are more appropriate for capturing vertically distributed elements of forest structure and change. The integration of optical remotely sensed imagery and LIDAR data provides improved opportunities to characterize post-fire conditions. The objective of this study is to compare changes in forest structure, as measured with a discrete return profiling LIDAR, to post-fire conditions, as measured with remotely sensed data. Our research is focused on a boreal forest fire that occurred in May 2002 in Alberta, Canada. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), the differenced NBR (dNBR), and the relative dNBR (RdNBR) were calculated from two dates of Landsat data (August 2001 and September 2002). Forest structural attributes were derived from two spatially coincident discrete return LIDAR profiles acquired in September 1997 and 2002 respectively. Image segmentation was used to produce homogeneous spatial patches analogous to forest stands, with analysis conducted at this patch level. In this study area, which was relatively homogenous and dominated by open forest, no statistically significant relationships were found between pre-fire forest structure and post-fire conditions (r {$<$} 0.5; p {$>$} 0.05). Post-fire forest structure and absolute and relative changes in forest structure were strongly correlated to post-fire conditions (r ranging from - 0.507 to 0.712; p {$<$} 0.0001). Measures of vegetation fill (VF) (LIDAR capture of cross-sectional vegetation amount), post-fire and absolute change in crown closure (CC), and relative change in average canopy height, were most useful for characterizing post-fire conditions. Forest structural attributes generated from the post-fire LIDAR data were most strongly correlated to post-fire NBR, while dNBR and RdNBR had stronger correlations with absolute and relative changes in the forest structural attributes. Absolute and relative changes in VF and changes in CC had the strongest positive correlations with respect to dNBR and RdNBR, ranging from 0.514 to 0.715 (p {$<$} 0.05). Measures of average inter-tree distance and volume were not strongly correlated to post-fire NBR, dNBR, or RdNBR. No marked differences were found in the strength or significance of correlations between post-fire structure and the post-fire NBR, dNBR, RdNBR, indicating that for the conditions present in this study area all three burn severity indices captured post-fire conditions in a similar manner. Finally, the relationship between post-fire forest structure and post-fire condition was strongest for dense forests ({$>$} 60\% crown closure) compared to open (26-60\%) and sparse forests (10-25\%). Forest structure information provided by LIDAR is useful for characterizing post-fire conditions and burn induced structural change, and will complement other attributes such as vegetation type and moisture, topography, and long-term weather patterns, all of which will also influence variations in post-fire conditions.

  abstract = {The ability to use digital remotely sensed data for forest inventory is often limited by the nature of the measures, which, with the exception of multi-angular or stereo observations, are largely insensitive to vertically distributed attributes. As a result, empirical estimates are typically made to characterize attributes such as height, volume, or biomass, with known asymptotic relationships as signal saturation occurs. Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes. Lidar has been established as an appropriate data source for forest inventory purposes; however, large area monitoring and mapping activities with lidar remain challenging due to the logistics, costs, and data volumes involved.The use of lidar as a sampling tool for large-area estimation may mitigate some or all of these problems. A number of factors drive, and are common to, the use of airborne profiling, airborne scanning, and spaceborne lidar systems as sampling tools for measuring and monitoring forest resources across areas that range in size from tens of thousands to millions of square kilometers. In this communication, we present the case for lidar sampling as a means to enable timely and robust large-area characterizations. We briefly outline the nature of different lidar systems and data, followed by the theoretical and statistical underpinnings for lidar sampling. Current applications are presented and the future potential of using lidar in an integrated sampling framework for large area ecosystem characterization and monitoring is presented. We also include recommendations regarding statistics, lidar sampling schemes, applications (including data integration and stratification), and subsequent information generation. \textcopyright{} 2012.},

  abstract = {Long-term sustainability of forest resources is in question given wide-spread use of conventional clear-cut silviculture. In response, variable retention (VR) harvest has been increasingly promoted as a landscape-based approach to enhance sustainability by maintaining biodiversity and other ecosystem functions in managed forests. Although the success of the VR approach depends on post-harvest stand dynamics, little is known about growth and mortality of residual trees after harvest and how such trees respond to interactions between amount of retention and tree or site level covariates. We use data from three censuses distributed over a 10-year period of the main merchantable species to study the effects of retention level (i.e., percent of trees retained), mixedwood cover type, tree species, and three tree or terrain covariates (tree stem diameter, percent live crown, and soil wetness) on survival and growth of residual trees in a retention harvest experiment in NW Alberta, Canada. Both mortality and growth of residual trees were negatively related to retention levels. During the first five-year period after harvest, effects of retention levels on mortality were more evident for white spruce (Picea glauca) than for Populus spp., but effects on growth were weaker for white spruce. Tree mortality decreased through time following VR harvest for all species and in most cover types, while trends in tree growth varied by species. During the second five-year period after harvest, growth of residual Populus spp. had decreased from high levels observed in the first period. In contrast, growth of residual white spruce was greater in the second five-year period than in the first period. After the original harvest, re-entry of stands for additional harvest focused mainly on hardwoods may be economically rewarding and ecologically justified, depending on the overall objectives for retention. The positive effect of increased retention level on tree survival was strongest for trees with larger diameter and longer crowns. Thus, retention patches are a management option to protect large trees and trees with greater crown length when retaining such trees is a management goal.},

  abstract = {1. In large-scale field surveys, a binary recording of each species' detection or nondetection has been increasingly adopted for its simplicity and low cost. Because of the importance of abundance in many studies, it is desirable to obtain inferences about abundance at species-, functional group-, and community-levels from such binary data. 2. We developed a novel hierarchical multi-species abundance model based on species-level detection {$\fracslash$} nondetection data. The model accounts for the existence of undetected species, and variability in abundance and detectability among species. Species-level detection {$\fracslash$} nondetection is linked to species level abundance via a detection model that accommodates the expectation that probability of detection (at least one individuals is detected) increases with local abundance of the species. We applied this model to a 9-year dataset composed of the detection {$\fracslash$} nondetection of forest birds, at a single post-fire site (from 7 to 15 years after fire) in a montane area of central Japan. The model allocated undetected species into one of the predefined functional groups by assuming a prior distribution on individual group membership. 3. The results suggest that 15-20 species were missed in each year, and that species richness of communities and functional groups did not change with post-fire forest succession. Overall abundance of birds and abundance of functional groups tended to increase over time, although only in the winter , while decreases in detectabilities were observed in several species. 4. Synthesis and applications. Understanding and prediction of large-scale biodiversity dynamics partly hinge on how we can use data effectively. Our hierarchical model for detection {$\fracslash$} nondetection data estimates abundance in space {$\fracslash$} time at species-, functional group-, and community-levels while accounting for undetected individuals and species. It also permits comparison of multiple communities by many types of abundance-based diversity and similarity measures under imperfect detection.},

  abstract = {The central concept of precision agriculture is to manage within-field soil and crop growth variability for more efficient use of farming inputs. Remote sensing has been an integral part of precision agriculture since the farming technology started developing in the mid to late 1980s. Various types of remote sensors carried on ground-based platforms, manned aircraft, satellites, and more recently, unmanned aircraft have been used for precision agriculture applications. Original satellite sensors, such as Landsat and SPOT, have commonly been used for agricultural applications over large geographic areas since the 1970s, but they have limited use for precision agriculture because of their relatively coarse spatial resolution and long revisit time. Recent developments in high resolution satellite sensors have significantly narrowed the gap in spatial resolution between satellite imagery and airborne imagery. Since the first high resolution satellite sensor IKONOS was launched in 1999, numerous commercial high resolution satellite sensors have become available. These imaging sensors not only provide images with high spatial resolution, but can also repeatedly view the same target area. The high revisit frequency and fast data turnaround time, combined with their relatively large aerial coverage, make high resolution satellite sensors attractive for many applications, including precision agriculture. This article will provide an overview of commercially available high resolution satellite sensors that have been used or have potential for precision agriculture. The applications of these sensors for precision agriculture are reviewed and application examples based on the studies conducted by the author and his collaborators are provided to illustrate how high resolution satellite imagery has been used for crop identification, crop yield variability mapping and pest management. Some challenges and future directions on the use of high resolution satellite sensors and other types of remote sensors for precision agriculture are discussed.},

  abstract = {Predictive models are central to many scientific disciplines and vital for informing management in a rapidly changing world. However, limited understanding of the accuracy and precision of models transferred to novel conditions (their 'transferability') undermines confidence in their predictions. Here, 50 experts identified priority knowledge gaps which, if filled, will most improve model transfers. These are summarized into six technical and six fundamental challenges, which underlie the combined need to intensify research on the determinants of ecological predictability, including species traits and data quality, and develop best practices for transferring models. Of high importance is the identification of a widely applicable set of transferability metrics, with appropriate tools to quantify the sources and impacts of prediction uncertainty under novel conditions.},

  abstract = {Protecting wildlife within areas of resource extraction often involves reducing habitat fragmentation. In Canada, protecting threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) populations requires preserving large areas of intact forest habitat, with some restrictions on industrial forestry activities. We present a linear programming model that assesses the trade-off between achieving an objective of habitat protection for caribou populations while maintaining desired levels of harvest in forest landscapes. The habitat-protection objective maximizes the amount of connected habitat that is accessible by caribou, and the forestry objective maximizes net revenues from timber harvest subject to even harvest flow, a harvest target, and environmental sustainability constraints. We applied the model to explore the habitat protection and harvesting scenarios in the Cold Lake caribou range, a 6726 km2 area of prime caribou habitat in Alberta, Canada. We evaluated harvest scenarios ranging from 0.1 Mm3{$\cdot$}year\textendash 1 to maximum sustainable harvest levels over 0.7 Mm3{$\cdot$}year\textendash 1 and assessed the impact of habitat protection measures on timber supply costs. Protecting caribou habitat by deferring or reallocating harvest increases the timber unit cost by Can\$1.1\textendash 2.0 m\textendash 3. However, this impact can be partially mediated by extending the harvest to areas of oil and gas extraction to offset forgone harvest in areas of prime caribou habitat.},

While most studies using this approach standardize data collection and study design parameters at the project or study level, recent trends in ecological research are to investigate patterns at regional or continental scales. Large-scale studies often require collaboration between research groups and integration of data from multiple sources to fulfil objectives, which can lead to variation in recording equipment and data collection protocols. Our objectives were to determine how analytical approaches and variation in data collection and processing that is typical of regional acoustic monitoring programmes influences accuracy when identifying vocal activity in breeding birds. We used data from three regional datasets in Northern Alberta, Northern British Columbia, and Southern and Central Yukon, Canada to investigate the effect of analytical framework, sample size, local species richness and data collection variables on classification accuracy. We found supervised classification approaches to be the most effective, with boosted regression trees identifying vocalizations of breeding birds in audio recordings with a 92.0\% accuracy and easily able to accommodate variation in data collection and processing parameters. We also provide recommendations on effectively processing large and heterogeneous datasets including sufficient sample size, accommodating potentially confounding variables and selecting suitable model training data. The results presented in this study can help inform decisions in data collection, data processing, and study design and analysis, maximize performance and accuracy during analysis, and efficiently process large, heterogeneous acoustic datasets to answer questions at scales previously difficult to investigate.},

  abstract = {Management of wetlands resources often requires assessment of changes in wetland vegetation over time. Accurate tracking of the expansion or retraction of invasive plant species is especially critical for natural resource managers who must make decisions on the deployment of effective control measures. Many available remote sensing strategies to quantify the location of invasive plant species are either too expensive to deploy on a regular basis or lack sufficient geographic or temporal resolution to be of use to resources managers. This paper presents the results of the use of a new unmanned aerial vehicle platform, called AggieAir (TM), and a new classification algorithm to track the spread of an invasive grass species, Phragmites australis, in a large and important wetland in northern Utah. The combination of high resolution multi-spectral images (in space and time) and the classification algorithm based on advances in statistical learning theory produce quantitative land cover descriptions that identify Phragmites locations with an accuracy of 95 percent. The combination of these two tools provides wetlands managers with new and potentially valuable methods to quantify the spread of Phragmites and to evaluate the efficacy of their attempts to control it.},

  abstract = {Conservation and monitoring of forest biodiversity requires reliable information about forest structure and composition at multiple spatial scales. However, detailed data about forest habitat characteristics across large areas are often incomplete due to difficulties associated with field sampling methods. To overcome this limitation we employed a nationally available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing dataset to develop variables describing forest landscape structure across a large environmental gradient in Switzerland. Using a model species indicative of structurally rich mountain forests (hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia), we tested the potential of such variables to predict species occurrence and evaluated the additional benefit of LiDAR data when used in combination with traditional, sample plot-based field variables. We calibrated boosted regression trees (BRT) models for both variable sets separately and in combination, and compared the models' accuracies. While both field-based and LiDAR models performed well, combining the two data sources improved the accuracy of the species' habitat model. The variables retained from the two datasets held different types of information: field variables mostly quantified food resources and cover in the field and shrub layer, LiDAR variables characterized heterogeneity of vegetation structure which correlated with field variables describing the understory and ground vegetation. When combined with data on forest vegetation composition from field surveys, LiDAR provides valuable complementary information for encompassing species niches more comprehensively. Thus, LiDAR bridges the gap between precise, locally restricted field-data and coarse digital land cover information by reliably identifying habitat structure and quality across large areas.},

  abstract = {Along with plant species composition forest structural complexity is an important determinant of forest biodiversity, but difficult to predict in space from field data. We analyzed forest structural complexity based on a comprehensive set of variables derived from nationally available, area-wide remote sensing, particularly LiDAR data. We generated variables related to vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneity, as well as site factors potentially indicating the abundance of weakened trees or snags. We used them to predict the occurrence of four bird species with narrow and complementary structural habitat requirements, together being indicative of structurally diverse forests. Presence/absence data of Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), Hazel Grouse (Bonasa bonasia), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) and Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium passerinum) from three biogeographic mountain regions in Switzerland were used to calibrate species distribution models (boosted regression trees BRT) for each species individually, as well as for the sympatric occurrence of at least three of the four target species. The predictive deviances explained and the AUC values obtained from cross-validation ranged from 15.5\% to 63.1\% and 0.77\% to 0.97\% respectively. Sympatric species occurrence reflecting overall forest structural complexity was predicted best, with an outstanding accuracy. To support management and monitoring schemes we identified variable threshold effects based on partial dependence plots. Variables related to vertical foliage distributions were most important, followed by horizontal structural attributes such as canopy height variations, forest edges and gaps. Site factors such as topographic position improved all models and were most important for the species depending on weakened trees and dead wood. We conclude that recent advances in remote sensing allow for large-scale determination of forest structural characteristics suitable for developing species and habitat distribution models of considerable generality, while keeping an unprecedented level of detail. Our approach allows forest managers to amend regional and countrywide management plans with reliable maps depicting areas of high forest structural complexity and habitat quality, which will facilitate the integration of conservation-relevant information into multifunctional forestry. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Four forest succession stages were adopted: stand initiation, young multistory, understory reinitiation, and old growth. Remote sensing metrics describing the spatial patterns of forest structures were derived and a Random Forest learning algorithm was used to classify forest succession stages. These metrics included texture variables from Gray Level Co-occurrence Measures (GLCM), range and sill from the semi-variogram, and the fraction of shadow and its spatial distribution. Among all the derived variables, shadow fractions and the GLCM variables of contrast, mean, and dissimilarity were the most important for characterizing the forest succession stages (classification accuracy of 89\%). In addition, a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) derived forest structural index (predicted Lorey's height) was employed to validate the classification result. The classification using imagery spatial variables was shown to be consistent with the LiDAR derived variable (R2 = 0.68 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 2.39). This study demonstrates that high spatial resolution imagery was able to characterize forest succession stages with promising accuracy and may be considered an alternative to LiDAR data for this kind of application. Also, the results of stand development stages build a framework for future wildlife habitat mapping.},

We combined airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with color-infrared (CIR) aerial imagery for identifying individual tree characteristics and quantifying multi-scale habitat requirements using the example of the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) (TTW) in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany). This bird, a keystone species of boreal and mountainous forests, is highly reliant on bark beetles dwelling in dead or dying trees. While previous studies showed a positive relationship between the TTW presence and the amount of deadwood as a limiting resource, we hypothesized a unimodal response with a negative effect of very high deadwood amounts and tested for effects of substrate quality. Based on 104 woodpecker presence or absence locations, habitat selection was modelled at four spatial scales reflecting different woodpecker home range sizes. The abundance of standing dead trees was the most important predictor, with an increase in the probability of TTW occurrence up to a threshold of 44-50 dead trees per hectare, followed by a decrease in the probability of occurrence. A positive relationship with the deadwood crown size indicated the importance of fresh deadwood. Remote sensing data allowed both an area-wide prediction of species occurrence and the derivation of ecological threshold values for deadwood quality and quantity for more informed conservation management.},

We add to this growing literature with one of the first studies to assess these effects in boreal and hemiboreal regions of North America. We conducted point counts in control and treatment areas for 2\textendash 3 years before (2009\textendash 2011) and 4\textendash 5 years after (2012\textendash 2016) the Pagami Creek Fire in northern Minnesota, USA. Our primary objectives were to (1) assess the effects of burn status, burn severity and burn heterogeneity on avian communities and patterns of abundance in individual bird species and (2) compare these results when counts were either restricted to 100 m count radii or corrected for potential detection heterogeneity. Species richness and total abundance of birds were best described by a burn severity by year interaction, with lower-severity burns having similar patterns to control areas and higher-severity burns showing reduced abundance and richness following the fire. Nevertheless, values associated with higher-severity burns returned to near-control levels after five years. Of 43 species analyzed, 27 showed detectable responses to the fire through shifts in abundance. Nearly equal proportions of these species had generally positive versus negative effects of the fire. Sixteen (59\%) of these fire responses were mediated by burn severity, while four (15\%) and seven (26\%) were best predicted by burn heterogeneity or burn status, respectively. Of the species whose response to the fire was mediated by burn severity, the majority (81\%) had decreased abundance as burn severity increased. However, all species responding to burn heterogeneity or burn status showed positive relationships to these metrics. Results were similar between analytical methods that adjusted for species detectability vs those that did not, with 78\% of species having the same interpretation of fire effects. Burn severity and heterogeneity, in addition to the sole distinction of whether an area was burned, dictate the response of birds to forest fire in hemiboreal forests. Mixed-severity fires, which include a range of burn severities and associated vegetation change, will likely benefit the most bird species in this region. When possible, management should focus on retaining this spectrum of post-fire conditions, though of primary importance is the inclusion of wildfire in forest planning and conservation efforts.},

Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

  abstract = {Wildfires and timber harvest are two of the most prevalent disturbances in North American forests. To evaluate and compare their impact on small mammals, I conducted meta-analyses on (1) the effect of stand-replacement wildfires and several types of forest harvest (clearcutting followed by burning, clearcutting, and uniform partial harvest) on the abundance of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi), (2) the impact of clearcutting and partial harvest on a broader array of small mammal species, and (3) the responses of small mammals to recent and older clearcuts (i.e. less than 10 years vs. 10-20 years after harvest). In coniferous and mixed forest, all disturbances except for partial harvest triggered significant increases in the abundance of deer mice and declines in red-backed voles. The increase in deer mice after wildfire was stronger than after clearcutting and marginally stronger than after clearcutting and burning. The abundance of red-backed voles was greatest in undisturbed or partially harvested stands, intermediate after clearcutting, and lowest after wildfire or clearcutting and burning. While the positive effect of clearcutting on deer mice did not persist beyond 10 years after disturbance, the negative effect on red-backed voles was similar between recent and older clearcuts. In deciduous forest, clearcutting did not result in a consistent change in abundance of deer mice and red-backed voles. For other small mammals, recent clearcutting tended to increase the abundance of yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), and meadow and long-tailed voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus and Microtus longicaudus). Woodland jumping mouse (Neozapus insignis), masked shrew (Sorex cinereus), and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) did not show consistent response to timber harvest. Overall, the impact of different disturbances on the abundance of small mammals (i.e. positive or negative) appears to be species-specific, but disturbance type may influence the magnitude of this effect. Disturbance types can be ranked from severe to mild in terms of small mammal responses. The effects of forest harvest on small mammals are not equivalent to those of wildfire. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
